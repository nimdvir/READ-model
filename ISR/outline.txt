**Title:** Enhancing Information Engagement through Computational Linguistics: A Predictive and Prescriptive Approach

**Abstract:**

- Brief overview of the importance of information engagement (IE) in digital content.
- Introduction to the research objective: improving IE using computational linguistics to predict and modify text for increased user engagement.
- Summary of methods: literature review, data collection, and three studies (exploratory, predictive, and prescriptive).
- Key findings: Identification of engaging words, development of the READ model, and effectiveness of the DIMA model in improving IE.
- Contributions to the fields of information systems, computational linguistics, and user experience design.

**1. Introduction**

- Contextualize the importance of digital information and the user experience (UX).
- Define the problem: the need for improved information engagement (IE) in digital content.
- Introduce the research goal: to use computational linguistics for enhancing creativity and engagement in written text.
- Outline the paper's structure.

**2. Literature Review**

- Define information engagement and its significance in UX.
- Review existing measures of IE and gaps in research.
- Theoretical foundations: User Engagement theory and Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT).
- Highlight the novelty of using computational linguistics to address IE.

**3. Methodology**

- Overview of the research approach and rationale.
- Description of data collection methods focusing on words' impact on engagement.
- Outline of the three studies: exploratory, predictive model development, and prescriptive model testing.

**4. Study 1: Exploratory Analysis**

- Objectives: To observe and predict user engagement with text.
- Method: Randomized controlled trials comparing synonyms' impact on IE dimensions.
- Results: Dataset creation of words rated on perception, participation, and perseverance.

**5. Study 2: Predictive Model Development**

- Introduction to the READ model: Representativeness, Ease of use, Affect, and Distribution.
- Methodology: Computational analysis of word features to predict IE.
- Results: Development and validation of a predictive model with high accuracy.

**6. Study 3: Prescriptive Model Testing**

- Objectives: To modify text using the predictive model to improve IE.
- Method: Application of NLP and AI to replace less engaging synonyms in digital content.
- Results: Significant improvements in IE dimensions across modified text examples.
