"With the proliferation of personal computing since the early 1990s and the advent of the Internet, information technology has spread outside the workplace-context applied in domains, such as leisure (e.g., computer gaming and instant messaging; van der Heijden, 2004), electronic retail and marketing (Barwise, Elberse, \& Hammond, 2002), and media "consumption" (e.g., online news; Chen \& Corkindale, 2008). As a consequence, experiential factors, such as aesthetics and enjoyment, have begun to receive increasing attention in human-computer interaction (HCI) (Alben, 1996; Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006), and user V Received February 6, 2014; revised May 7, 2014; accepted May 23, 2014 \copyright{} 2015 ASIS\&T Published online in Wiley Online LibraryOnline experience (UX) has become a major area of research (van Schaik \& Ling, 2009). The concept of UX is predicated on the idea that interactive technologies not only deliver functional benefits, but they also deliver experiences, and users' intention to (re)live positive experiences is an important driver of the use and adoption of technology (Hassenzahl, 2003). A rationale for research in UX is that the success of interactive technologies is fundamentally connected to their ability to promote high-quality experiences, beyond their capacity to support the completion of instrumental tasks. Consequently, the main aim of UX research is to establish how positive experiences with interactive technologies can be promoted (Law \& van Schaik, 2010)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/1}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2471})

"Since most major news providers in the Western world launched online versions of their newspapers in the middle of the 1990s (Hall, 2001), news websites have become a favored source of news for many (Allan, 2006). Ever since, the news sector has increasingly used the web as a publication platform and online news plays a significant role in how people acquire information about the world (Nguyen, 2008). At present, most news sites are not merely online versions of print newspapers. Developers spend a growing amount of effort on enhancing the interactivity of news sites, thereby promoting, for example, ease of access to a wide variety of news, communication among users, and user-generated content. The Internet is more than just another medium for journalism. Online news has a great influence on how people access information (e.g., quick access to frequently updated news from Internet-enabled portable devices), how news stories are created and published (e.g., collaborative publishing; Bruns, 2005), and on the roles of journalists and readers (e.g., participatory journalism; Deuze, Bruns, \& Neuberger, 2007)."

"tablets), ease of access to information in general and to (online) news in particular is increasing. For example, an estimated 78\% of the population in North America had access to the Internet as of March 2011 (Internet World Stats, 2011) and 47\% of the adults in the United States accessed local information and news on mobile phones or tablet computers in 2010 (Rosenstiel \& Mitchell, 2011). As another example, 77\% of households in Great Britain in 2011 had access to the Internet and 45\% of users used a mobile phone to access the Internet (Office for National Statistics, 2011). Consequently, news sites can be accessed by the majority of readers potentially anytime and anywhere." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/2}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2472})
\par
"Hall (2001) argues that the monopoly of large media conglomerates (such as General Electric, the Walt Disney Company, and News Corporation) is harder to defend on the Internet than in the largely monopolized print and broadcast media, due to the large number of sources of information and the relative ease and low cost for anybody to publish on the web; therefore, these companies are forced back into a more competitive business environment when publishing online. As a consequence, transparency (Karlsson, 2011), trust in news providers (Kohring \& Matthes, 2007), and experiential factors (e.g., enjoyment and mental workload) may play a greater role in the success of news websites. Therefore, news sites that provide highquality experiences are expected to promote ongoing, repeated interaction. However, despite the growing importance of online news publishing in the media sector and a shifting focus towards experiential factors in HCI, there is a lack of academic research on news sites in terms of UX constructs and their structural relationships. Although the news sector has had an increasing presence on the web in recent years, there is a lack of knowledge about how news sites can be designed to promote a high-quality UX. It is therefore timely to investigate how various aspects of experience (e.g., antecedents, components, and outcomes of experience) are related in a model of UX with news websites. Furthermore, we argue for the joint consideration of technology acceptance and UX for the primary reason that even if an artifact is highly usable and delivers high-quality experiences, its potential benefits in terms of effective and efficient task performance and enjoyment will not be realized if potential users are not willing to employ it. Modeling of acceptance can clarify how UX, together with previously established other factors, influences users' technology acceptance (see van Schaik \& Ling, 2011). Modeling UX without considering acceptance may not be enough, because repeated visits to news sites (and conducting repeat business on websites in general) requires users' acceptance of the site. Research has found that technology acceptance variables (e.g., perceived usefulness) are antecedents of online loyalty (e.g., Cyr, Head, \& Ivanov, 2006; Cyr, Hassanein, Head, \& Ivanov, 2007). Therefore, an integrated approach to the study of UX and technology acceptance is justified (see van Schaik \& Ling, 2011)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/2}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2472})
\par
"Although the HCI and IS literature offers a wealth of models and theoretical frameworks for technology acceptance and UX, these models have not been previously applied to and tested using news sites as an interactive artifact. Models of technology acceptance include the technology acceptance model (TAM; Davis, 1989) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, \& Davis, 2003). Models of UX include Hassenzahl's (2003) UX model and the components of UX (CUE) model (Th\"uring \& Mahlke, 2007). The scope of the original TAM (Davis, 1986) is restricted to explaining variation in intention to use and subsequent use behavior of computer systems from variation in the behavioral belief constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (and the later-removed attitude construct). However, the model has been augmented with a wide range of variables over the past two decades to increase its explanatory power in different fields of application (see Venkatesh \& Davis, 2000; Wixom \& Todd, 2005). Additional variables include perceived enjoyment (Davis, Bagozzi, \& Warshaw, 1992), internal and external control, intrinsic motivation and emotion (Venkatesh, 2000), design aesthetics (Cyr et al., 2006), user-interface design, and satisfaction (Cho, Cheng, \& Lai, 2009). Notably, several of the mentioned variables address experiential aspects of technology acceptance. TAM has been successfully adopted in the study of web technologies (Lederer, Maupin, Sena, \& Zhuang, 2000; Cho et al., 2009), and it is a well-established, robust, and powerful model for predicting user-acceptance; therefore, the constructs of the model and their established structural relationships are considered relevant to the current work. Although Chen and Corkindale (2008) applied the technology acceptance model to online news, their work did not include psychometric measurement of the model's components and testing of the model; rather, it was based on interviews with media experts. By contrast, the current study develops a measurement and a structural model of users' experience with news sites, rather than a model of acceptance based on the knowledge and intuition of news providers and developers of news sites." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/3}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2473})
\par
"UX models differ from models of technology acceptance most notably because of their direct focus on experiential aspects, frequently referred to as hedonic or noninstrumental attributes. Hassenzahl's UX model distinguishes pragmatic and hedonic aspects of user-perceived attributes of interactive technologies. While pragmatic attributes encompass utility and usability that allow for the manipulation of systems, hedonic attributes encompass factors that make interaction with a particular technology pleasurable by fulfilling human needs, such as autonomy, competency, stimulation (self-oriented), relatedness, and popularity (othersoriented) (Hassenzahl, 2008). Furthermore, Hassenzahl and Roto (2007) argue that while pragmatic attributes emphasize the fulfillment of behavioral goals (do-goals), hedonic attributes emphasize psychological well-being, in other words" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/3}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2473})

"be-goals, which stand closer to the self and are important drives of emotional product attachment.1 Hassenzahl (2008) identified the ability of interactive products to support need fulfillment as a source of affective reactions in relation to the use of interactive technologies. Hassenzahl, Diefenbach, and G\"oritz (2010) assessed the relationships between the fulfillment of universal human needs, positive affect, and perceptions of product attributes. The study revealed significant relationships between need fulfillment and positive affect, and need fulfillment was related to hedonic quality perceptions. Furthermore, in accordance with the distinction between hygiene factors and motivator factors (Zhang \& von Dran, 2000), the role of usability as a hygiene factor2 was supported. Additionally, O'Brien (2011b) concluded that human-information interactions and UX share a common focus in recognizing the significance of needs and made a case for taking" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/3}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2473})

"The components of the user-experience (CUE) model (Th\"uring \& Mahlke, 2007) aims to integrate the most important aspects of HCI by incorporating various facets of interaction characteristics, UX, and system appraisal. We chose this model as a basis for developing our own model in the current research, as it appears to be the most comprehensive published UX model to date. There are three types of UX components in the model: instrumental qualities, noninstrumental qualities, and emotional responses. Instrumental qualities concern usefulness and ease of use, and correspond to pragmatic attributes in Hassenzahl's UX model. Noninstrumental qualities concern aspects such as aesthetics, the "look-and-feel" of the system, and identification, and correspond to hedonic attributes in Hassenzahl's UX model. The category of noninstrumental qualities generally incorporates aspects that are important to users but are not connected to their performance with a system. Emotional reactions in the model are characterized with multiple components, such as subjective feelings, motor expressions, and cognitive appraisals (see Mahlke \& Minge, 2008)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/3}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2473})
\par
"The model treats UX components as consequences of interaction characteristics, which involve three groups of variables: characteristics of the interactive artifact, characteristics of the user, and task/context characteristics. Outcome variables in the model, which are, in turn, predicted from UX components, include both acceptance and overall evaluations. In summary, the CUE model seems to be an adequate conceptual framework for incorporating a wide range of technology-acceptance and UX components." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/3}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2473})
\par
"focusing on properties of (sets of) news items in accounting for positive experience, we consider user-perceived properties of news sites as interactive artifacts (or products). We use an empirically tested and comprehensive UX model (Th\"uring \& Mahlke, 2007) as a basis for modeling UX with news sites, as well as a qualitative study (Aranyi, van Schaik, \& Barker, 2012) of users' self-reported factors of experience with news sites to guide the selection of variables."

"(online) news in particular is increasing. For example, an estimated 78\% of the population in North America had access to the Internet as of March 2011 (Internet World Stats, 2011) and 47\% of the adults in the United States accessed local information and news on mobile phones or tablet computers in 2010 (Rosenstiel \& Mitchell, 2011). As another example, 77\% of households in Great Britain in 2011 had access to the Internet and 45\% of users used a mobile phone to access the Internet (Office for National Statistics, 2011). Consequently, news sites can be accessed by the majority of readers potentially anytime and anywhere. Hall (2" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/2}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2472})

"glomerates (such as General Electric, the Walt Disney Company, and News Corporation) is harder to defend on the Internet than in the largely monopolized print and broadcast media, due to the large number of sources of information and the relative ease and low cost for anybody to publish on the web; therefore, these companies are forced back into a more competitive business environment when publishing online. As a consequence, transparency (Karlsson, 2011), trust in news providers (Kohring \& Matthes, 2007), and experiential factors (e.g., enjoyment and mental workload) may play a greater role in the success of news websites. Therefore, news sites that provide highquality experiences are expected to promote ongoing, repeated interaction. However, despite the growing importance of online news publishing in the media sector and a shifting focus towards experiential factors in HCI, there is a lack of academic research on news sites in terms of UX constructs and their structural relationships. Although the news sector has had an increasing presence on the web in recent years, there is a lack of knowledge about how news sites can be designed to promote a high-quality UX. It is therefore timely to investigate how various aspects of experience (e.g., antecedents, components, and outcomes of experience) are related in a model of UX with news websites. Furthe ogy acceptance and UX for the primary reason that even if an artifact is highly usable and delivers high-quality experiences, its potential benefits in terms of effective and efficient task performance and enjoyment will not be realized if potential users are not willing to employ it. Modeling of acceptance can clarify how UX, together with previously established other factors, influences users' technology acceptance (see van Schaik \& Ling, 2011). Modeling UX without considering acceptance may not be enough, because repeated visits to news sites (and conducting repeat business on websites in general) requires users' acceptance of the site. Research has found that technology acceptance variables (e.g., perceived usefulness) are antecedents of online loyalty (e.g., Cyr, Head, \& Ivanov, 2006; Cyr, Hassanein, Head, \& Ivanov, 2007). Therefore, an integrated approach to the study of UX and technology acceptance is justified (see van Schaik \& Ling, 2011)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_C3W75T9P/2}{Aranyi and van Schaik 2015:2472})

"Although the HCI and IS literature offers a wealth ofmodels and theoretical frameworks for technology accep-e tance and UX, these models have not been previouslyd applied to and tested using news sites as an interactive arti-- fact. Models of technology acceptance include the technol-- ogy acceptance model (TAM; Davis, 1989) and the unifiedtheory of acceptance and use of technology (Venkatesh,e Morris, Davis, \& Davis, 2003). Models of UX includef Hassenzahl's (2003) UX model and the components of UXs (CUE) model (Th\"uring \& Mahlke, 2007). The scope of the original TAM (Davis, 1986) is restrictedc to explaining variation in intention to use and subsequentl use behavior of computer systems from variation in the behavioral belief constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use (and the later-removed attitude construct). However, the model has been augmented with a wide rangeof variables over the past two decades to increase its explanatory power in different fields of application (see Venkatesh \& Davis, 2000; Wixom \& Todd, 2005). Addi-y tional variables include perceived enjoyment (Davis, Bagozzi, \& Warshaw, 1992), internal and external control,- intrinsic motivation and emotion (Venkatesh, 2000), design aesthetics (Cyr et al., 2006), user-interface design, and satisfaction (Cho, Cheng, \& Lai, 2009). Notably, several of thet mentioned variables address experiential aspects of technology acceptance.

"Our work is motivated by the fact that millions of users interact with online content without providing any explicit feedback about the quality of their experience. Therefore, deducing in an online, implicit and scalable manner how they feel is considered a high-value task. Given this, our main objective is to understand how cursor behaviour can inform us about well known user engagement measures [29], such as aect, attention, and interest."

"In particular, we consider cursor behaviour irrespective of the page layout, the elements it contains, or their relative position. Therefore, our method can be seen as a baseline regardless of the context of application. We then engineer a large set of features and use various clustering techniques, combined through a robust aggregation framework, in order to conduct our analysis. Through it, we identify how the frequency of such patterns changes over dierent degrees of engagement. We also derive a taxonomy of cursor patterns, which may generally characterize mouse behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1440})

"Overall, this paper makes the following contributions: We propose a scalable and non-invasive methodology for measuring within-content engagement, based on mouse gestures, that is applicable to dierent contexts. We deliver a taxonomy of mouse gestures using an unsupervised learning approach. We evaluate our methodology through a controlled user study, and identify tangible associations between certain types of mouse gestures and engagement metrics. As a validation step, and real-life use case, we consider the task of predicting within-content engagement (interestingness), solely on the basis of cursor interactions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1440})

"RELATED WORK In the online industry, user engagement is dened as the amount of attention and time users are willing to spend on a website and how likely they are to return to it. Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \textbackslash within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]."

"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \textbackslash interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})

"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})

"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300 600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study."

"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \textbackslash crime and law", \textbackslash entertainment and lifestyle", \textbackslash science") and article interestingness (two levels: \textbackslash interesting", \textbackslash uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data. Other dependent variables were participants' preand post-task aect, level of focused attention, as well as reported interestingness of the news articles."

"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})
\par
"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \textbackslash You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})
\par
"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \textbackslash I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \textbackslash I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p {$<$} :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p {$<$} :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results."

\par
"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95\%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations."

\par
"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1444})

"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/7}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1445})

"The availability of large volumes of interaction data and scalable data mining techniques have made possible to study the online behaviour for millions of Web users. Part of the eorts have focused on understanding how users interact and engage with web content." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1439})
\par
"However, the measurement of within-content engagement remains a dicult and unsolved task. This is because of the lack of standardised, wellvalidated methods for measuring engagement, especially in an online context. To address this gap, we perform a controlled user study where we observe how users respond to online news in the presence or lack of interest. We collect mouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures. The proposed method does not use any pre-determined concepts to characterise the cursor patterns. We, rather, follow an unsupervised approach and use a large set of features engineered from our data to extract the cursor patterns. Our ndings support the connection between gaze and cursor behaviour but also, and more importantly, reveal other dependencies, such as the correlation between cursor activity and experienced aect. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our method by predicting the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1439})

"In particular, we consider cursor behaviour irrespective of the page layout, the elements it contains, or their relative position. Therefore, our method can be seen as a baseline regardless of the context of application. We then engineer a large set of features and use various clustering techniques, combined through a robust aggregation framework, in order to conduct our analysis. Through it, we identify how the frequency of such patterns changes over dierent degrees of engagement. We also derive a taxonomy of cursor patterns, which may generally characterize mouse behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1440})

"Overall, this paper makes the following contributions: We propose a scalable and non-invasive methodology for measuring within-content engagement, based on mouse gestures, that is applicable to dierent contexts. We deliver a taxonomy of mouse gestures using an unsupervised learning approach. We evaluate our methodology through a controlled user study, and identify tangible associations between certain types of mouse gestures and engagement metrics. As a validation step, and real-life use case, we consider the task of predicting within-content engagement (interestingness), solely on the basis of cursor interactions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1440})

"RELATED WORK In the online industry, user engagement is dened as the amount of attention and time users are willing to spend on a website and how likely they are to return to it. Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \textbackslash within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]."

"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \textbackslash interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention.

"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})

"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300 600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study."

\par
"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \textbackslash crime and law", \textbackslash entertainment and lifestyle", \textbackslash science") and article interestingness (two levels: \textbackslash interesting", \textbackslash uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data.

"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})
\par
"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \textbackslash You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1441})
\par
"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \textbackslash I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \textbackslash I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p {$<$} :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p {$<$} :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances."

\par
"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1442})
\par
"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results."

\par
"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95\%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations."

"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis-Lalmas-Valkanas 2014:1444})

One challenge would be to develop sucient ground truth under real-life conditions and at large scale, with the help of other testing methods like bucket testing and query log analysis. Comparing the mouse gestures identied by the proposed method against this kind of ground truth will let us validate whether they have the required physical characteristics and are well-founded, and further ensure that our approach is grounded in more than intuitive plausibility. Finally, we will investigate the sequential nature of mouse gestures using stochastic models that can describe the process of how the data is being generated and account for the transitions between the mouse gestures."

"The availability of large volumes of interaction data and scalable data mining techniques have made possible to study the online behaviour for millions of Web users. Part of the eorts have focused on understanding how users interact and engage with web content." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis et al 2014:1439})
\par
"However, the measurement of within-content engagement remains a dicult and unsolved task. This is because of the lack of standardised, wellvalidated methods for measuring engagement, especially in an online context. To address this gap, we perform a controlled user study where we observe how users respond to online news in the presence or lack of interest. We collect mouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures. The proposed method does not use any pre-determined concepts to characterise the cursor patterns. We, rather, follow an unsupervised approach and use a large set of features engineered from our data to extract the cursor patterns. Our ndings support the connection between gaze and cursor behaviour but also, and more importantly, reveal other dependencies, such as the correlation between cursor activity and experienced aect. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our method by predicting the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis et al 2014:1439})

Therefore, our method can be seen as a baseline regardless of the context of application. We then engineer a large set of features and use various clustering techniques, combined through a robust aggregation framework, in order to conduct our analysis. Through it, we identify how the frequency of such patterns changes over dierent degrees of engagement. We also derive a taxonomy of cursor patterns, which may generally characterize mouse behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})

We deliver a taxonomy of mouse gestures using an unsupervised learning approach.  We evaluate our methodology through a controlled user study, and identify tangible associations between certain types of mouse gestures and engagement metrics.  As a validation step, and real-life use case, we consider the task of predicting within-content engagement (interestingness), solely on the basis of cursor interactions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})

"RELATED WORK In the online industry, user engagement is dened as the amount of attention and time users are willing to spend on a website and how likely they are to return to it. Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \textbackslash within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})
\par
"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \textbackslash interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})

"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little  exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})

"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300  600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study."

\par
"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \textbackslash crime and law", \textbackslash entertainment and lifestyle", \textbackslash science") and article interestingness (two levels: \textbackslash interesting", \textbackslash uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data. Other dependent variables were participants' preand post-task aect, level of focused attention, as well as reported interestingness of the news articles."

"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \textbackslash You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \textbackslash I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \textbackslash I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p {$<$} :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p {$<$} :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results."

\par
"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95\%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis et al 2014:1444})
\par
"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis et al 2014:1444})

"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/7}{Arapakis et al 2014:1445})

"understanding of user online behaviour is considered a highvalue task. Mouse tracking can address this need in a lowcost and scalable manner, and without removing the users from their natural setting. To this end, we demonstrated in detail a rigorous methodology for extracting purposeful mouse gestures from cursor coordinates; a high-level representation of cursor interactions. More, specically, we conducted a small-scale, controlled user study and recorded the cursor data of users that interacted with interesting and non-interesting web content. From that data, we engineered a large set of features and used unsupervised learning to build a taxonomy of cursor patterns that share similar properties. In our analysis, we considered cursor behaviour independently of the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position. Finally, we demonstrated the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})
\par
"Furthermore, we identied several signicant correlations between cursor behaviour and focused attention, preNAS, prePAS, postNAS, postPAS, and aect. More specically, we noticed that certain types of mouse gestures are negatively correlated with focused attention, with negative aect at preand post-task, and at a lesser extent with positive aect at preand post-task. This basically translates to negative emotions being more in uential on cursor behaviour than positive ones. This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences. Considering the challenge of explaining user behaviour using cursor pattern analysis, but also identifying to what extent these patterns are good indicators of aect, this makes it a novel and noteworthy nding. Additionally, we observe a more profound correlation between cursor behaviour and our user engagement measures compared to the correlation reported between gaze behaviour and user engagement measures [1]. This leads us to conclude that aect is, to some extent, \textbackslash measurable" and can be anticipated to a certain degree" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})

"Our prediction experiments also revealed that it is possible to measure content interestingness by accounting for the frequency of the cursor patterns changes and, subsequently, predict user engagement over time. Our best performing model, using the stacked generalization method with classiers 1NN and SMO, attained the accuracy of 75\%, which is considerably better than the baseline. These results are further supported by the statistical analysis we performed on the frequency distribution of mouse gestures, which indi" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})
\par
"Our analysis of cursor interactions provides several insights into the nature of engagement. Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns. Although this may not be a new nding, considering previous research on mouse-gaze interactions [18, 24, 25], it provides evidence that connects our methodological approach to analysing cursor behaviour with gaze and demonstrates the utility of mouse tracking as a scalable, cost-eective alternative to eye tracking" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})

"cated a signicant dierence between interesting and uninteresting news articles. Overall, this suggests an interaction eect between web content interestingness and cursor behaviour. Unlike prior research eorts that have analysed mouse tracking data, our approach does not involve manual or costly attempts (e.g., eye tracking). Also, the proposed method was designed to be as independent as possible from the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position, making it applicable to broader and more heterogeneous contexts. Finally, our work comes with certain limitations. One of them is the relatively small sample of the population we studied. To some extent, this has aected our ability to generalise our ndings to the population as a whole. However, this is a very common caveat in user studies and, in our case, a necessary trade-o, given the controlled and timedemanding nature of our experiment. Also, there is room for improvement, both with respect to the accuracy of the classiers and the feature selection. Our modelling approach can benet from experimenting with additional machine learning techniques, and a more thorough evaluation of our feature set, to improve its discriminative power" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/10}{Arapakis et al 2014:1448})

"In particular, we consider cursor behaviour irrespective of the page layout, the elements it contains, or their relative position. Therefore, our method can be seen as a baseline regardless of the context of application. We then engineer a large set of features and use various clustering techniques, combined through a robust aggregation framework, in order to conduct our analysis. Through it, we identify how the frequency of such patterns changes over dierent degrees of engagement. We also derive a taxonomy of cursor patterns, which may generally characterize mouse behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})

"Overall, this paper makes the following contributions:  We propose a scalable and non-invasive methodology for measuring within-content engagement, based on mouse gestures, that is applicable to dierent contexts.  We deliver a taxonomy of mouse gestures using an unsupervised learning approach.  We evaluate our methodology through a controlled user study, and identify tangible associations between certain types of mouse gestures and engagement metrics.  As a validation step, and real-life use case, we consider the task of predicting within-content engagement (interestingness), solely on the basis of cursor interactions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})

"RELATED WORK In the online industry, user engagement is dened as the amount of attention and time users are willing to spend on a website and how likely they are to return to it. Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \textbackslash within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})
\par
"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \textbackslash interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})

"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little  exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})

"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300  600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study."

"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \textbackslash crime and law", \textbackslash entertainment and lifestyle", \textbackslash science") and article interestingness (two levels: \textbackslash interesting", \textbackslash uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data.

"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that in uence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \textbackslash You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \textbackslash I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \textbackslash I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p {$<$} :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p {$<$} :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})

"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results."

"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95\%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations."

"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis et al 2014:1444})

"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/7}{Arapakis et al 2014:1445})

"understanding of user online behaviour is considered a highvalue task. Mouse tracking can address this need in a lowcost and scalable manner, and without removing the users from their natural setting. To this end, we demonstrated in detail a rigorous methodology for extracting purposeful mouse gestures from cursor coordinates; a high-level representation of cursor interactions. More, specically, we conducted a small-scale, controlled user study and recorded the cursor data of users that interacted with interesting and non-interesting web content. From that data, we engineered a large set of features and used unsupervised learning to build a taxonomy of cursor patterns that share similar properties. In our analysis, we considered cursor behaviour independently of the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position. Finally, we demonstrated the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences."

\par
"Furthermore, we identied several signicant correlations between cursor behaviour and focused attention, preNAS, prePAS, postNAS, postPAS, and aect. More specically, we noticed that certain types of mouse gestures are negatively correlated with focused attention, with negative aect at preand post-task, and at a lesser extent with positive aect at preand post-task. This basically translates to negative emotions being more in uential on cursor behaviour than positive ones. This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences. Considering the challenge of explaining user behaviour using cursor pattern analysis, but also identifying to what extent these patterns are good indicators of aect, this makes it a novel and noteworthy nding. Additionally, we observe a more profound correlation between cursor behaviour and our user engagement measures compared to the correlation reported between gaze behaviour and user engagement measures [1]. This leads us to conclude that aect is, to some extent, \textbackslash measurable" and can be anticipated to a certain degree" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})

"Our analysis of cursor interactions provides several insights into the nature of engagement. Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns. Although this may not be a new nding, considering previous research on mouse-gaze interactions [18, 24, 25], it provides evidence that connects our methodological approach to analysing cursor behaviour with gaze and demonstrates the utility of mouse tracking as a scalable, cost-eective alternative to eye tracking" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})

"The availability of large volumes of interaction data and scalable data mining techniques have made possible to study the online behaviour for millions of Web users. Part of the eorts have focused on understanding how users interact and engage with web content." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis et al 2014:1439})
\par
"However, the measurement of within-content engagement remains a dicult and unsolved task. This is because of the lack of standardised, wellvalidated methods for measuring engagement, especially in an online context. To address this gap, we perform a controlled user study where we observe how users respond to online news in the presence or lack of interest. We collect mouse tracking data, which are known to correlate with visual attention, and examine how cursor behaviour can inform user engagement measures. The proposed method does not use any pre-determined concepts to characterise the cursor patterns. We, rather, follow an unsupervised approach and use a large set of features engineered from our data to extract the cursor patterns. Our ndings support the connection between gaze and cursor behaviour but also, and more importantly, reveal other dependencies, such as the correlation between cursor activity and experienced aect. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our method by predicting the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis et al 2014:1439})
\par
"Our work is motivated by the fact that millions of users interact with online content without providing any explicit feedback about the quality of their experience. Therefore, deducing in an online, implicit and scalable manner how they feel is considered a high-value task. Given this, our main objective is to understand how cursor behaviour can inform us about well known user engagement measures [29], such as aect, attention, and interest." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/1}{Arapakis et al 2014:1439})
\par
"In particular, we consider cursor behaviour irrespective of the page layout, the elements it contains, or their relative position. Therefore, our method can be seen as a baseline regardless of the context of application. We then engineer a large set of features and use various clustering techniques, combined through a robust aggregation framework, in order to conduct our analysis. Through it, we identify how the frequency of such patterns changes over dierent degrees of engagement. We also derive a taxonomy of cursor patterns, which may generally characterize mouse behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})
\par
"Overall, this paper makes the following contributions:  We propose a scalable and non-invasive methodology for measuring within-content engagement, based on mouse gestures, that is applicable to dierent contexts.  We deliver a taxonomy of mouse gestures using an unsupervised learning approach.  We evaluate our methodology through a controlled user study, and identify tangible associations between certain types of mouse gestures and engagement metrics.  As a validation step, and real-life use case, we consider the task of predicting within-content engagement (interestingness), solely on the basis of cursor interactions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})

"RELATED WORK In the online industry, user engagement is dened as the amount of attention and time users are willing to spend on a website and how likely they are to return to it. Engagement is usually described as a combination of cognitive processes (in this paper we focus on aect, focused attention and interest) traditionally measured using surveys. User engagement is also measured at large-scale through analytic tools assessing users' depth of interaction with a website, which include metrics such as dwell time and clickthrough rate. It has been argued that \textbackslash within-page activity could inform [...] about the quality of the content on a page", which could be measured by tracking mouse movements [9]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1440})
\par
"This paper expands on previous work presented in [1], where we investigate the eect of sentimentality and polarity of news articles on user engagement. We used a collection of online news articles and examined their variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content. We also demonstrated how gaze behaviour and attention dier across news articles of varying interestingness, through a controlled user study. In the current work, we take a more scalable approach to measuring engagement and look at the eect of \textbackslash interestingness" on cursor behaviour. We also examine how cursor behaviour is linked to subjective measures of engagement such as aect and focused attention. Finally, we validate our approach against gaze metrics and reliable qualitative ground truth" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})

"EXPERIMENTAL SETUP There are several approaches to carrying out a study in our context: bucket testing, log analysis, and controlled user study. The rst two methods allow the analysis of real-life or recorded data at large scale, but oer little exibility for introducing new parameters. In addition, it is not easy to control certain parameters and observe the actual user experience. On the other hand, user studies are typically much smaller in scale [2], but a wider range of parameters can be explored in a controlled manner. The downside is the di- culty of generalising the ndings. In our work, we choose to conduct a small-scale, controlled user study, and record the cursor data of users interacting with web content of varying interestingness. We use a collection of online news with relatively unstructured, heterogeneous content. In what follows, we provide an outline of our experimental setup and refer the reader to [1] for additional details." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})

"News Dataset Our dataset contained 383 news articles crawled from Yahoo News US over a period of two weeks, from three dierent genres: crime and law, entertainment and lifestyle and science. All news articles were presented in the same format. We kept the news articles that had between 300  600 words to mitigate any eects due to the uneven article length. We then randomly selected 40 articles from each genre and asked twenty-four human judges to rate them on a 5-point interestingness scale. The reported scores allowed us to pre-rank the news articles and narrow down our selection to three interesting and three uninteresting candidates per article genre, prior to conducting our study."

"To avoid any adverse eects because of language-specic bias, we evaluated their English language uency during the tutorial" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"Design The experiment had a mixed design with two independent variables: article genre (three levels: \textbackslash crime and law", \textbackslash entertainment and lifestyle", \textbackslash science") and article interestingness (two levels: \textbackslash interesting", \textbackslash uninteresting"). The primary dependent variable was participants' online behaviour as determined by the mouse and eye tracking data. Other dependent variables were participants' preand post-task aect, level of focused attention, as well as reported interestingness of the news articles." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"Measures of Engagement A psychometric scale was used to capture the hedonic and cognitive aspects of user experience: the User Engagement Scale (UES) [30]. The UES items pertain to positive and negative aect, users' felt involvement, and focused attention during the task. Aect refers to the emotion mechanisms that inuence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustained engagement [37]. Focused attention [29] refers to the feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. We also tracked cursor activity and gaze" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"PANAS: The Positive and Negative Aect Scale [37] was used to measure the aect before and after each task. PANAS includes 10 items measuring positive aect (PAS) and 10 items measuring negative aect (NAS). Participants were asked to respond on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to the statement: \textbackslash You feel this way right now, that is, at the present moment", for each item." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1441})
\par
"Focused Attention: A 9-item focused attention subscale [29], was adapted to the context of the news reading task. The focused attention scale has been used in past work [28] to evaluate users' perceptions of time passing and their degree of awareness about what was taking place outside of their interaction with a task. For our news reading task, participants were instructed to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to each item (e.g., \textbackslash I was so involved in my news task that I lost track of time")" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Interest: To validate the eectiveness of our experimental manipulation, we measured the perceived article interest at post-task by asking the participants to state on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement to questions such as \textbackslash I found the news article interesting to read", etc. The reported scores were converted into binary judgments by assigning disagreement or neutral opinion to the uninteresting condition and agreement to the interesting condition. The binary judgments were then compared against the pre-task labelling of the news article interestingness. The Chi-Square test revealed a signicant association (2 = 29:52; p {$<$} :001) between the two measures, with a strong positive relationship ( = :518; p {$<$} :001), which conrms the eect of our experimental manipulation. The follow-up analysis is based on the levels of perceived article interestingness reported at post-task and consists of slightly imbalanced classes; 23 interesting and 21 uninteresting instances." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Eye Tracking: The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of xation happens infrequently. Therefore, gaze is considered a strong indicator of attention [10] and the utility of eye tracking in information processing tasks like reading [3] and micro-blogging [6] is well known. In our study, eye movements were recorded using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker integrated into a 17" TFT monitor with a 12801024 resolution. The pupil locations were extracted at a rate of 50 Hz and were mapped to gaze locations on the screen. We compute the eye metrics reported in [1]. Mouse Tracking: We used smt2 [22], an open source, client-server architecture mouse tracking tool. The smt2 uses JavaScript to log mouse and browser-related events at a congurable frequency, and stores the data at xed-time intervals. This process does not interfere with the user's browsing experience or introduce delays associated with data capture. We set the recording rate at 40 ms, which provides a reasonable tradeo between data quantity and granularity of the recorded mouse events [20]. Our relatively high recording rate allows us to pick up micro-pauses or ballistic movements, resulting in clearly-dened tra jectories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"Features Our task is to predict within-content engagement and, in particular, the interestingness of online news content. To this end, we explore a large number of features engineered from the cursor data. Our features, presented in Table 1, are computed for each mouse gesture as a whole and for all consecutive pairs of points found in it, and are categorised under nine main headings depending on how or where the feature is obtained from. We do not apply any heuristics to characterise our gestures or pre-determine, for example, whether they represent a horizontal or vertical scroll;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/4}{Arapakis et al 2014:1442})
\par
"To measure the importance of each feature with respect to our goals, we perform a preliminary correlation analysis. Given that the predicted class is binary (interesting, uninteresting) we compute the point-biserial correlation coecient (rpb ). We ignore the sign of the correlation which depends on the way we encode the variables. Table 1 shows several signicant small-to-medium size correlations between our features and news article interestingness. The eect sizes from our correlation analysis appear to be in line with those reported in previous studies [14, 15]. We now introduce the features we use, and comment on signicant results."

"We use the most powerful frequency (with respect to velocity and acceleration) of each mouse gesture as a feature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis et al 2014:1444})
\par
"Preprocessing We apply two types of transformation: normalisation and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). We normalise each feature to the [0; 1] range, to avoid having attributes in greater numeric ranges dominating those in smaller numeric ranges. We use PCA for dimensionality reduction, but select enough eigenvectors to account for some percentage of the variance in the original data; in our case 95\%. This resulted in 4 datasets: original, normalised, PCA, and normalised+PCA. We ran the following analysis on each dataset, but report on the best performing one, which is the original, without transformations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis et al 2014:1444})
\par
"Unsupervised Learning A key objective for us is to derive generic mouse movements which are associated with user engagement measures. By generic, we mean that we need to abstract away from gestures characteristics of an individual to gestures shared by the study's participants. Therefore, we employ clustering, to group together similar mouse gestures and movement patterns. Given that we target more cognitive processes, we would like a robust analytical framework. Therefore, instead of relying on a single clustering algorithm, which could be easily biased, we use multiple techniques and reach a consensus through rank aggergation, which is known to be eective in removing noise [8]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/6}{Arapakis et al 2014:1444})
\par
"We collected questionnaire data on the experienced aect, focused attention, and degree of interest from 44 news reading tasks, carried out by 22 participants. A 5-point Likert scale was used in all questionnaires with high scores representing a stronger agreement and low scores representing a weaker perception with the given statement. Participants responses to the 10-item PAS, 10-item NAS, and 9-item focused attention scale were summed to obtain the nal scores. The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was applied to determine the signicance of the variance observed in the frequency distribution of mouse gestures between interesting and uninteresting news articles. The results indicated a statistically signicant dierence (z = 3:817; p = :000; r = 0:171) between the counts of dierent categories of mouse gestures, suggesting an interaction eect between news article interestingness and cursor behaviour. We note that as interestingness we regard the level of interestingness reported by the participants at post-task. When examining the eye metrics, the Wilcoxon SignedRank test reveals dierences in gaze behaviour. More specifically, we observe that participants took signicantly less time to perform their rst xation (TFF) on the news article in the interesting condition (z = 2:718; p = :007; r = 0:377), while they xated more times on other elements (FB) when the news article was uninteresting (z = 2:925; p = :003; r = 0:405). Furthermore, participants performed signicantly more xations (FC) and for longer periods (FD, TFD) when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:117; p = :034; r = 0:293; z = 2:076; p = :038; r = 0:288; z = 2:258; p = :024; r = 0:313). Finally, they looked more times (VC) at the body of article AOI, and the duration of each individual visit lasted longer (VD), when reading an interesting news article (z = 2:312; p = 0:020; r = 0:320; z = 2:258; p = 0:024; r = 0:313). These ndings are in line with those reported in previous work [1], where we demonstrate the impact of news article interestingness on the gaze behaviour of male and female participants. For example, in [1], we observe that male participants perform their rst xation faster on a news article when the content is interesting and, in addition, perform signicantly less xations outside of the body of the news article. No signicant dierences were observed for female participants. We note, however, that in this paper we do not group our participants according to gender since we do not account for it in our cursor data analysis. The signicant differences discovered in gaze behaviour establish a connection to user engagement but also suggest common gaze patterns across both genders. This nding suggests that knowledge of the user gender is not as important for gaze and, as an extension, to its proxy, the cursor. In regards to mouse tracking, this is a positive nding in the sense that predicting the user's gender would be a non-trivial task" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/7}{Arapakis et al 2014:1445})

"understanding of user online behaviour is considered a highvalue task. Mouse tracking can address this need in a lowcost and scalable manner, and without removing the users from their natural setting. To this end, we demonstrated in detail a rigorous methodology for extracting purposeful mouse gestures from cursor coordinates; a high-level representation of cursor interactions. More, specically, we conducted a small-scale, controlled user study and recorded the cursor data of users that interacted with interesting and non-interesting web content. From that data, we engineered a large set of features and used unsupervised learning to build a taxonomy of cursor patterns that share similar properties. In our analysis, we considered cursor behaviour independently of the page layout, the type of elements it contains, or their relative position. Finally, we demonstrated the value of our approach in a user engagement scenario, where we predict the outcome of online news reading experiences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})
\par
"Furthermore, we identied several signicant correlations between cursor behaviour and focused attention, preNAS, prePAS, postNAS, postPAS, and aect. More specically, we noticed that certain types of mouse gestures are negatively correlated with focused attention, with negative aect at preand post-task, and at a lesser extent with positive aect at preand post-task. This basically translates to negative emotions being more inuential on cursor behaviour than positive ones. This observation is consistent with previous work [24] demonstrating that mouse-related signals are sensitive to frustrating and unpleasant experiences. Considering the challenge of explaining user behaviour using cursor pattern analysis, but also identifying to what extent these patterns are good indicators of aect, this makes it a novel and noteworthy nding. Additionally, we observe a more profound correlation between cursor behaviour and our user engagement measures compared to the correlation reported between gaze behaviour and user engagement measures [1]. This leads us to conclude that aect is, to some extent, \textbackslash measurable" and can be anticipated to a certain degree" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})
\par
"Our analysis of cursor interactions provides several insights into the nature of engagement. Foremost, when examining gaze behaviour, we observed signicant dierences between the news articles of dierent interestingness that spanned across several eye metrics, like time to rst xation, duration of xation, xation count, and total visit duration. These dierences were also noticed in cursor interactions and were found to be correlated to the eye metrics. The message here is that engagement manifests in dierent forms such as the gaze behaviour of users that develop an emotional, cognitive, and behavioural connection with a digital resource (e.g., an interesting news article), but also as observable and distinct mouse cursor patterns. Although this may not be a new nding, considering previous research on mouse-gaze interactions [18, 24, 25], it provides evidence that connects our methodological approach to analysing cursor behaviour with gaze and demonstrates the utility of mouse tracking as a scalable, cost-eective alternative to eye tracking" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GCZT4UEG/9}{Arapakis et al 2014:1447})

"Measures of Engagement We examined engagement both as a process and as an outcome of an online news reading experience. Given its multi-faceted nature, we employed a set of sub jective and ob jective measures, such as positive and negative affect, focused attention, and gaze behaviour: Affect refers to the emotion mechanisms that influence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustaining our engagement [McCay-Peet et al., 2012, O'Brien, 2011, Watson et al., 1988] during an information processing task or a computermediated activity.

"cused attention [O'Brien and Toms, 2010], a feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. Gaze behaviour is also known to be associated with attention, interest, and perception, and has been extensively studied in information processing tasks like reading [Buscher et al., 2010], visual search [Pannasch et al., 2011], scene perception [Henderson, 2003], and recently in micro-blogging [Counts and Fisher, 2011]. The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of fixation happens infrequently. As with other components of voluntary performance (e.g., walking or maintenance of balance), looking is controlled by a general intention, and consciousness plays a minor role in the execution of the intended sequence of fixations [Kahneman, 1973]."

\par
"Online content providers, like news portals and social media platforms, constantly seek new ways to attract large shares of online attention by keeping their users engaged. A common challenge is to identify which aspects of online interaction influence user engagement the most. In this article, through an analysis of a news article collection obtained from Yahoo! News US, we demonstrate that news articles exhibit considerable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content, depending on factors like news provider and genre. Moreover, through a laboratory study, we observe the effect of sentimentality and polarity of news and comments on a set of subjective and objective measures of engagement. In particular, we show that attention, affect, and gaze differ across news of varying interestingness. As part of our study, we also explore methods that exploit the sentiments expressed in user comments to reorder the lists of comments displayed in news pages. Our results indicate that user engagement can be predicted if we account for the sentimentality and polarity of the content, as well as other factors that drive attention and inspire human curiosity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GPFD6VX7/1}{Arapakis et al 2014:1988})

"In general, interest in online content is highly asymmetrical; only a small portion of that content receives significant attention, while the remaining majority is barely noticed [Szabo and Huberman, 2010]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GPFD6VX7/2}{Arapakis et al 2014:1989})

"In this work, one of our goals is to bridge the divide between sentiment metrics that derive from the content and offline behaviour measures of engagement. We aim to establish which aspects of user interaction influence engagement the most in the online news domain. To this end, we conducted an analysis of 13,319 news articles taken from Yahoo! News US.1 Our analysis demonstrates that news articles exhibit considerable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content, depending on variables like news provider and genre. Given that variation, we employed a smaller subset of our news collection and observed the real-life effects of articles' sentiment characteristics on the news reading experience, through a correlation analysis" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GPFD6VX7/3}{Arapakis et al 2014:1990})
\par
"Sentiment-rich content is more attractive and can provide useful insights about the general sentiment tendency towards a topic. This theory is partly supported by our findings, which suggest that web users are drawn to highly sentimental news that are characterised by a negative polarity. This makes sense since news headlines are written to induce emotional reactions and attract people's attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_GPFD6VX7/7}{Arapakis et al 2014:1994})

\par
"Measures of Engagement We examined engagement both as a process and as an outcome of an online news reading experience. Given its multi-faceted nature, we employed a set of sub jective and ob jective measures, such as positive and negative affect, focused attention, and gaze behaviour: Affect refers to the emotion mechanisms that influence our everyday interactions and can act as the primary motivation for sustaining our engagement [McCay-Peet et al., 2012, O'Brien, 2011, Watson et al., 1988] during an information processing task or a computermediated activity. Another measure, also central to user engagement, is fo- 2 The sentimentality and polarity of a user comment is computed by averaging the individual values associated with the sentences in the user comment, as discussed in Section 2.2."

"cused attention [O'Brien and Toms, 2010], a feeling of energised focus and total involvement, often accompanied by loss of awareness of the outside world and distortions in the subjective perception of time. Gaze behaviour is also known to be associated with attention, interest, and perception, and has been extensively studied in information processing tasks like reading [Buscher et al., 2010], visual search [Pannasch et al., 2011], scene perception [Henderson, 2003], and recently in micro-blogging [Counts and Fisher, 2011]. The importance of gaze in the assessment of engagement lies in the fact that, although looking might appear to be a process that is under voluntary control, conscious and deliberate control of fixation happens infrequently. As with other components of voluntary performance (e.g., walking or maintenance of balance), looking is controlled by a general intention, and consciousness plays a minor role in the execution of the intended sequence of fixations [Kahneman, 1973]."

  abstract = {Prominent news sites on the web provide hundreds of news articles daily. The abundance of news content competing to attract online attention, coupled with the manual effort involved in article selection, necessitates the timely prediction of future popularity of these news articles. The future popularity of a news article can be estimated using signals indicating the article's penetration in social media (e.g., number of tweets) in addition to traditional web analytics (e.g., number of page views). In practice, it is important to make such estimations as early as possible, preferably before the article is made available on the news site (i.e., at cold start). In this paper we perform a study on cold-start news popularity prediction using a collection of 13,319 news articles obtained from Yahoo News, a major news provider. We characterize the popularity of news articles through a set of online metrics and try to predict their values across time using machine learning techniques on a large collection of features obtained from various sources. Our findings indicate that predicting news popularity at cold start is a difficult task, contrary to the findings of a prior work on the same topic. Most articles' popularity may not be accurately anticipated solely on the basis of content features, without having the early-stage popularity values.},

In doing so, marketers have to select the type of information system they want to utilize in order to deliver the most appropriate information to their consumers. One of the most interesting and distinguishing dimensions of such information systems is the level of control the consumer has over the information system. The current work presents and tests a general model for understanding the advantages and disadvantages of information control on consumers' decision quality, memory, knowledge, and confidence. The results show that controlling the information flow can help consumers better match their preferences, have better memory and knowledge about the domain they are examining, and be more confident in their judgments. However, it is also shown that controlling the information flow creates demands on processing resources and therefore under some circumstances can have detrimental effects on consumers' ability to utilize information.

"Focused attention. Being engaged in an experience involves focusing attention to the exclusion of other things, including other people (unless social interaction enhances the engagement) [28]. This phenomenon relates to distortions in the subjective perception of time during interaction [29], which has been shown to be an e↵ective indicator of cognitive involvement [2] and has been used as a component in measures of games immersion [18]. The more engaged someone is, the more likely they are to underestimate the passage of time. Together with concentration, absorption and loss of self-consciousness, distortions in the subjective perception of time have led to parallels being drawn between engagement and the idea of flow as an optimal experience [9], where flow refers to a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in what they are doing."

For example, O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that a lack of fun can act as a barrier to shopping online and that fun during a webcast can draw the user in, although a lack of awareness of other viewers can mitigate against the quality of the fun experience. Jennings [19] argues that a↵ective experiences are intrinsically motivating and that, in relation to engagement on the web, an initial a↵ective hook can induce a desire for exploration or active discovery. This, they argue then encourages greater emotional involvement and contributes to customer loyalty (see endurability below). They regard affect as"an emotional investment that helps create a personal link to an experience or activity" [19]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

"Aesthetics. Aesthetics concerns the sensory, visual appeal of an interface and is seen as an important factor for engagement [29]. In the context of online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting and video games, O'Brian \& Toms [28] relate aesthetics to factors such as screen layout, graphics and the use of design principles such as symmetry and balance. In the context of multimedia design, Jennings [19] relates aesthetics (in this case media quality) to positive a↵ect and suggests that aesthetic experiences promote focused attention and stimulate curiosity. The significance of aesthetics was well demonstrated by Tractinsky \& Ikar [45] who, in an experiment in which users interacted with a computerised, surrogate Automated Teller Machine, found a positive correlation between perceived usability and aesthetic appeal, even though no such correlation existed between perceived usability and actual usability."

"Endurability. People remember enjoyable, useful, engaging experiences and want to repeat them. This aspect of engagement refers to the likelihood of remembering an experience and the willingness to repeat it [35]. It also relates to a users' willingness to recommend an experience to others, and to their perceptions of whether an experience met their expectations of being "successful", "rewarding", or "worthwhile" [29]. In the context of the web, endurability can be related to the notion of 'sticky' content and the goal of holding the user's attention and encouraging them to return. O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that having fun, being rewarded with convenience and incentives, and discovering something new promoted later re-engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Novelty. Interactive experiences can be engaging because they present users with novel, surprising, unfamiliar or unexpected experiences. Novelty appeals to our sense of curiosity, encourages inquisitive behaviour and promotes repeated engagement [29]. It can arise through freshness of content or innovation in information technology [13]. In e-commerce applications, shoppers can enjoy the experience of becoming sidetracked, browsing just to see what is there [28]. It has been shown that learners experience higher levels of engagement during multimedia presentations that exhibit higher levels of variety [48]. However, there is also suggestion of the importance of a subtle balance between novelty on the one hand and familiarity on the other. For example, in gam-" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

\par
"Richness and control. The "Richness, Control and Engagement" (RC \& E) framework [37] explains levels of engagement in terms of the levels of richness and control that are shaped by the features of a product and the user's expertise. Richness captures the growth potential of an activity by assessing the variety and complexity of thoughts, actions and perceptions as evoked during the activity (e.g., variety, possibilities, enjoyment, excitement, challenge). Control captures the extent to which a person is able to achieve this growth potential by assessing the e↵ort in the selection and attainment of goals (clarity, ease, self confidence, freedom). Through experiments on a digital voicemail system, where they varied the number of features of the user interface, the amount of voicemail content and the type of task, Rozendaal et al. [37] showed that level of engagement could be predicted according to the level of richness and control experienced." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/3}{Attfield et al 2011:3})

Trust is not only a matter of the insurances o↵ered by technology (e.g. encrypted communications), but also depends on implicit contracts between people, computers, and organisations [22]. Organisations in "real life" do rely on consumers' faith in the information or service provided. For example, telephone companies are required to correctly connect calls and protect the integrity of phone numbers. Similar requirements can be issued when transposing trust to the web.

\par
"ubjective measures Where the subjective characteristics of an interactive experience have been defined, it is possible to construct a postexperience questionnaire to measure them in relation to a given interactive experience. Such an instrument was developed by O'Brian, Toms and colleagues. They first [28] report a literature review and exploratory interview study with users in four domains (online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting, and video games). Through their analysis they identify a set of attributes of user engagement (some of which are listed above). They then used this initial conceptualisation to develop a questionnaire to assess userengagement among online shoppers [29]. They administered their survey to 440 online shoppers and used factor analysis to reduce the characteristics to a set of key constructs. Their survey provides a standardised instrument for eliciting users engagement assessments. O'Brian et al's aim was to produce a general purpose user engagement questionnaire. However, user engagement almost certainly has di↵erent characteristics in di↵erent application domains and for di↵erent demographic groups. The web o↵ers a diversity of experiences relevant to a diversity of users. The properties of engagement during instant messaging, for example, may di↵er from the properties of engagement with a news portal. Aesthetic appeal may be an important factor for engagement with a films website whilst trust has been found to be a key factor in engagement with health websites [50]. Related to this, di↵erent user populations may have di↵erent priorities. Whereas fun may be an important characteristic for engaging children [35], ease of navigation may be a higher priority for adults. Some characteristics of engagement may generalise well, others may not." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

"One issue that arises with post-experience questionnaires and tests, however, is that they are not sensitive to ways in which an interaction changes over time. Interactions are dynamic and engagement fluctuates [28]. In the interests of di↵erentiating aspects of an interactive experience it may be valuable to measure such temporal changes. In this case post-experience questionnaires may not be the best tool, and objective measures seem more well suited." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

"There are a number of drawbacks to questionnaires and other subjective measures. These include their reliance on the user's subjectivity [42], post-hoc interpretation and their susceptibility to the halo e↵ect1 [38]. A common strategy to overcome these is to develop objective measures that can reliably indicate subjective states [16].

To date little has been reported on this, but since engagement is multifaceted and complex, a number of di↵erent variables may be useful to measure. In the following we discuss some measures used in previous research. What becomes evident is that each objective measure tend to target a very specific aspect of engagement, unlike questionnaires, which can address a range of variables. In light of this and our proposal that di↵erent engagement characteristics are relevant for di↵erent kinds of situation, we anticipate that it will be both useful and necessary to establish a range of objective measures and use this range to predict engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

This can involve retrospectively probing for how long an activity lasted or asking a user to indicate the duration of fixed time-intervals during the activity [2]. Despite its name, we regard SPT as an objective measure given that it is assessed against actual time. To ask somebody to report how long an activity has lasted or estimate an interval is to ask them a question they can get wrong (by di↵erent degrees). In a sense it is a measure of performance.

"Physiological data can be captured by a broad range of sensors [15] related to di↵erent cognitive states. Examples of sensors are eye trackers (diculty, attention, fatigue, mental activity, strong emotion), mouse pressure (stress, certainty of response), biosensors (e.g. temperature for negative affect and relaxation, electrodermal for arousal, blood flow for stress and emotion intensity), oximiters (e.g., pulse), camera (e.g., face tracking for general emotion detection). Such sensors have several advantages over questionnaires or online behaviour, since they are more directly connected to the emotional state of the user, are more objective (involuntary body responses) and they are continuously measured. They are however more invasive and cannot be used in large scale studies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/5}{Attfield et al 2011:5})

"Ikehara and Crosby [15] have used such sensors to assess the cognitive load of a "game" (tracking fractions). Jennett et al. [18] also report the use eye-tracking data to assess immersion. They found that eye-movement increases over time during a non-immersed experience and reduces over time during an immersed experience. Users seem to focus on fewer targets during engaged attention. In general, such measures could be highly indicative of immersive states through their links with attention, a↵ect, the perception of aesthetics and novelty. Research is required to refine our understanding of precisely what physiological states are indicative of engagement and how to di↵erentiate against negative states of high arousal such as stress."

"A related approach can be found in the patent Methods and systems for detecting user satisfaction (US Patent 7587324) where the inventors propose to measure user satisfaction by assigning a utility value to each sequence of actions (between a user and a computer interface) and comparing this value to a baseline. User interaction patterns have also be used to predict search engine switching behaviour [49], which is a facet of user engagement. From a commercial perspective, assessments of online behaviour fall within the scope of customer engagement (CE). CE is an instrument of marketing referring to the engagement of customers with one another, with a company or a brand. Its more recent form considers online CE. Online CE enables organisations to respond to the changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as the increasing ine↵ectiveness of the traditional"interrupt and repeat"broadcast model of advertising. Supporting"deep"engagement is seen as an important source of competitive advantage, whether through advertising, user generated product reviews, FAQs, forums where consumers can socialise or contribute to product development. In this space, a number of initiatives have emerged to address the question of CE metrics from organisations such as the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and Nielsen Media Research. As in the academic literature, engagement is seen as multifaceted and open to a range of potential metrics [43]. Information retrieval (IR) metrics. Among the di↵erent lines of research in IR metrics, three are directly related to measuring user engagement. The first is to develop metrics for interactive IR, e.g., [5, 17] where users and their contexts are taken into account. This line has brought up the idea of simulated search scenarios, where a subject is asked to follow a search scenario that specifies what, why, and in which context the user is searching. The second line of research is to develop metrics that incorporate enriched user interaction models, e.g., [33, 21, 51]. This is needed when old assumptions typical of traditional IR (linear browsing, binary relevance) do not hold. The work of e.g. Piwowarski \& Dupret [33] and Kazai et al.

Our approach is holistic but convergent, following a general progression from: (i) Empirical and analytic exploration of the characteristics of user engagement (ii) Correlating and resolving these to integrated models and reliable measures both objective and subjective (iii) Design and validation of prototypes Within the approach, we propose the following three main directions of work: (1) identification of interaction patterns and development of engagement measures for a range of contexts and services; (2) adaptation of immersion concepts from gaming; and (3) designing for user engagement. The first two lines of research try to define user engagement in various contexts, along with metrics and methodologies for measuring it. The third gives direct and practical means to deploying definitions, metrics and methodologies for designing engaging technologies. These lines of research are not independent from each other, but represent related aspects that will undoubtedly influence and inform the overall approach for defining and measuring user engagement. We elaborate on each in the next sections." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"Developing measures and models of user engagement The goal of the first line of investigation is to obtain an understanding of how a range of user engagement characteristics relate to specific user contexts and scenarios and how they can be calculated using state-of-the-art web analytic metrics, IR metrics, and existing or novel user engagement measures. This would expand on the work of O'Brian and colleagues at the University of Dalhousie [28, 29]. In our opinion, their work presents the most significant progress towards understanding and assessing user engagement to date." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"an important goal will be to derive reliable and reusable metrics for user engagement that are specific to particular contexts and online services. In order to do so, it is necessary to collect and catalogue existing and new engagement characteristics and indicators. Such characteristics can be tested for correlation with a range of existing measures, such as standard IR metrics for assessing web search engines and web analytics measures. This would involve setting up a series of "lab-based" user experiments (combinations of virtual, online lab experiments, actual lab environments, and in-situ studies) around specific user tasks and usage scenarios in which users' perceived values are studied for various characteristics through questionnaires and other subjective measures. Data would also be collected through observation and logging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"It is important that experiments are carried out on a sufficiently large and diverse sample of the user population and using a (feasibly) wide range of design variants, user tasks and motivations to ensure generalisability. To reduce bias, appropriate sampling methods with respect to the user population have to be used. Psychological techniques such as experience sampling2 (e.g., [8]) can be used to gain insights on user interactions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"From these experiments, dependency relationships can be established among the di↵erent engagement characteristics, leading to classes of user models for the di↵erent contexts and task types. A specific point of interest is the relationship between incentive structures, rewards, benefits and engagement. The derived user engagement models can then be validated through further experiments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"In order to assess the full range of variables of engagement, it is necessary to test a multitude of scenarios, interaction and graphics designs, for example, di↵erent page layouts, result presentations, modified user interaction models (such as result peek, scratch pad), etc. We anticipate the need for continuous refinement to this methodology, allowing fluid adaptation to the latest findings and the research questions that such results raise." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"Summarising, this line of research will deal with: (1) Classifying characteristics of user engagement as relevant to particular contexts, user tasks, and incentives, and in particular, validating characteristics relevant to web interactions (extending our current work); (2) Identifying whether characteristics can be automatically derived using standard or more advanced web analytic measures or IR metrics and developing prediction models when applicable; (3) Identifying patterns of user engagement (leading to the development of models of user engagement), both from qualitative (surveys, questionnaires, focus groups, participatory design, etc.) and quantitative points of view (through log analysis); (4) Developing from this a methodology for measuring and understanding user engagement, including methods for comparative measures across brands and methods for failure analysis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"New perspectives from immersion in gaming and related areas The goal of the second line of research is to develop novel concepts of user engagement through an examination of the notion of immersion as it is used in gaming." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"in a computer game involves being "drawn in", with attention focussed entirely on the game [18]. As such, this phenomenon has much in common with engagement and many ideas emerging from this and related research may be applicable to more general notions of user engagement and notions of user engagement on the web in particular. Some early work on the application of the concept of immersion is Bhatt's [3] preliminary study of interaction with a range of e-commerce web sites. Bhatt finds the relative importance of immersion (compared to interactivity and connectivity) to be genre-dependent; for example, it is far more significant to the fashion industry than it is to the financial industry. This finding concurs with our initial view of the applicability of immersion to user engagement and also the context dependant nature of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"In relation to immersion, of particular interest is the work of Cairns and colleagues. Their early work [6] reported a user study of immersion in gaming. They observed three progressively deeper levels of immersion, which they referred o as engagement, engrossment, and total immersion. In a" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})

"CEGE is a hierarchical model that elaborates a set of necessary conditions of an enjoyable gaming experience. For example, a positive experience depends on the user taking "ownership" of a game, where ownership involves developing high-level strategies and goals and receiving rewards. But this itself is built upon lowerlevel factors such as "control" elements (e.g., interface factors, small actions, point-of-view) and "facilitators" (such as time to play and the user's aesthetic values)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Calvillo-Gamez et al. [7] argue that many of these factors can be meaningfully extrapolated to other kinds of interaction, such as the use of productivity applications." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We propose further exploration of the concept of immersion and concepts from related domains (such as flow, and presence in Virtual Reality experiences) in order to expand and enrich existing notions of engagement. Underpinning this work will be the aim of expanding our understanding of the necessary constituents of an engaging experience. We believe that this can bring valuable new perspectives to the measurement of user engagement on the web. The expected outcomes are: (1) Understanding the links (and contrasts) between user engagement and immersion (and to some extent flow and presence); (2) Leveraging this understanding to enrich our model of user engagement; (3) Developing additional metrics relevant to search and di↵erent genres of web interaction; (4) Conceptual input into largerscale experimentation in tandem with the first line of work (Section 3.1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Designing for user engagement This last line of research explicitly focuses on designing for user engagement, by providing a useful source of validated design ideas. This is based on insights from the other two lines of research to inform the development, validation and refinement of design concepts (initiated in the first line of research - Section 3.1) for services and tools aimed at promoting user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"To conduct such a research, an iterative, user-centred design process incorporating evaluation throughout, should be adopted. Initial qualitative field studies can be used to identify and characterise particular kinds of interaction scenario" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"and their requirements. Scenarios should include individual interaction as well as collaboration, sharing and social interactions. Each scenario would provide a basis for developing conceptual designs, which implement generalisable strategies for promoting engagement appropriate to the context. Prototypes ranging from low to high-fidelity can be developed and evaluated iteratively, with early formative evaluations leading to the development of design improvements. Summative evaluations can then be used to assess design alternatives in terms of user engagement metrics developed in other areas of the work. Overall the process will be aimed at generating and testing generalisable design strategies for promoting engagement in di↵erent contexts, ultimately resulting in reusable recommendations, guidelines and exemplars which can be employed by other designers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"An approach to the cataloguing and communication of design strategies, which we favour, is to record these in the form of interaction design patterns [4]. Patterns are an approach to capturing reusable solutions to recurring design problems within semi-formal representations. As such they o↵er a convenient basis for generating a 'lingua franca' of design solutions that encapsulate a particular set of design values (in this case the promotion of engagement)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"The expected outcomes of this line of research are to: (1) Evaluate prototype solutions for promoting user engagement in a range of contexts; (2) Produce generalisable design recommendations in the form of reusable interaction design patterns." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we advocate the development of an approach for studying, measuring, and explaining user engagement. We first define user engagement, and then report on and classify various characteristics and potential methods for measurement. User engagement is a multifaceted, and complex phenomenon; this applies to both its definition and empirically grounded "signature" characteristics. Both of these give rise to a number of potential approaches for measurement whether objectively or subjectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We proposed three lines of research that have the potential to shape what we like to refer as the science of user engagement. The first two define methodologies for measurement, whilst the third outlines how these methodologies can lead to user engagement aware front-end technology design." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_IASZ3ZBJ/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Our proposed approach is motivated by the aim of achieving an innovative yet principled approach to the problems associated with measuring user engagement, building on existing solid and fundamental work and methodology, and taking inspiration from other related areas."

\textbf{Extracted Annotations (4/20/2018, 6:36:36 AM)}
\par
"User engagement is a key concept in designing user-centred web applications. It refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasises the positive aspects of the interaction, and in particular the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"This definition is motivated by the observation that successful technologies are not just used, but they are engaged with. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature to measure engagement, however, little has been done to validate and relate these measures and so provide a firm basis for assessing the quality of the user experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"Engagement is heavily influenced, for example, by the user interface and its associated process flow, the user's context, value system and incentives. In this paper we propose an approach to relating and developing unified measures of user engagement. Our ultimate aim is to define a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained, leading to recommendations and guidelines for user interface and interaction design for front-end web technology. Towards this aim, in this paper, we consider how existing user engagement metrics, web analytics, information retrieval metrics, and measures from immersion in gaming can bring new perspective to defining, measuring and explaining user engagement."

"human computer interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"computers and connectivity have come to pervade all aspects of our lives. We have computers in our homes and in our pockets. The continually evolving web provides unprecedented choice of things we can do; we can educate ourselves or others, buy and sell, watch movies, keep up with friends, write blogs, share content, play games, or simply indulge a passing curiosity. With this the conceptualisation of the user has also changed. Kuutti [23] describes this evolution as being from a cog in an organisational machine and a "source of error", to a partner in social interaction and ultimately consumer, and more recently, with Web 2.0, to content creator." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"In line with this transformation, researchers and practitioners in user-centred design have increasingly seen the need to extend traditional performance-based notions of usability, such as e↵ectiveness, eciency and satisfaction (ISO 9241-11), to encompass non-utilitarian aspects of interaction (e.g., [12, 24]). Under the broad rubric of user experience, there is emphasis on understanding and designing for the subjective aspects of technology encounters (e.g., [24, 47])." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"In a world full of choices where the fleeting attention of the user becomes a prime resource, it is essential that technology providers do not just design systems but that they design engaging experiences [31]. Indeed, in an environment of choice, failing to engage the user "equates with no sale on an electronic commerce site and no transmission of information from a website; people go elsewhere" [28]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"The question then becomes: how do we do this, and closely related to that, how do weassess the experience as being the kind we would like to design" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"The answer lies in the study of user engagement, a quality of user experience that emphasises the positive aspects of interaction, and in particular the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology (and so being motivated to use it) [28]. Successful technologies are not just used, they are engaged with; users invest time, attention, and emotion into the equation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"To promote user engagement we need to be able to design for it. To know when we have done this we need some way of assessing and measuring it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"Only by knowing when and why engagement occurs can we understand what is e↵ective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"As discussed in this paper, many works on user engagement have been written, but they are spread over a range of different areas of research, thus hindering the possibility of building upon previous research. We thus need a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured and explained, leading to, for example, recommendations and" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"guidelines for user interface and interaction design, that is, we need a science of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Towards this goal, this paper contains our proposal to establish the "science of user engagement". It has two main contributions. First, we provide a review and classification of prior research on user engagement and associated measures (Section 2), with a special focus on the work carried out outside large-scale web log analysis" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Based on this review, and our insights, we then present our proposed research agenda providing a detailed roadmap on how to define and set up a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"USER ENGAGEMENT IN THE LITERATURE In this section, we provide a review of prior research on user engagement. We start with our own definition based on our review of that literature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"User engagement is the emotional, cognitive and behavioural connection that exists, at any point in time and possibly over time, between a user and a resource." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"This definition is intentionally broad. By identifying emotional, cognitive, and behavioural factors, it emphasises the holistic character of user engagement and is also suggestive of aspects that are open to measurement. It also refers equally to user engagement in terms of a single session or a more long-term relationship across multiple session. User engagement with a technological resource is not just about how a single interaction unfolds, but about how and why people develop a relationship with technology and integrate it into their lives." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Characteristics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"In the following we discuss some characteristics associated with user engagement, either as presented by previous studies or as suggested by us." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"These elaborate the notion of engagement over the three broad dimensions: emotional, cognitive and behavioural. While some of the characteristics have stronger ties with one of the dimensions, most are a combination of the three." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"They also provide some orientation for thinking about the designable causes and observable consequences of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Focused attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Focused attention. Being engaged in an experience involves focusing attention to the exclusion of other things, including other people (unless social interaction enhances the engagement) [28]. This phenomenon relates to distortions in the subjective perception of time during interaction [29], which has been shown to be an e↵ective indicator of cognitive involvement [2] and has been used as a component in measures of games immersion [18]. The more engaged someone is, the more likely they are to underestimate the passage of time. Together with concentration, absorption and loss of self-consciousness, distortions in the subjective perception of time have led to parallels being drawn between engagement and the idea of flow as an optimal experience [9], where flow refers to a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in what they are doing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Aesthetics." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Endurability." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Positive A↵ect. "Engaged users are a↵ectively involved" [28]. A↵ect relates to the emotions experienced during interaction. For example, O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that a lack of fun can act as a barrier to shopping online and that fun during a webcast can draw the user in, although a lack of awareness of other viewers can mitigate against the quality of the fun experience. Jennings [19] argues that a↵ective experiences are intrinsically motivating and that, in relation to engagement on the web, an initial a↵ective hook can induce a desire for exploration or active discovery. \textbf{This, they argue then encourages greater emotional involvement and contributes to customer loyalty (see endurability below).} They regard affect as"an emotional investment that helps create a personal link to an experience or activity" [19]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

"Aesthetics. Aesthetics concerns the sensory, visual appeal of an interface and is seen as an important factor for engagement [29]. In the context of online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting and video games, O'Brian \& Toms [28] relate aesthetics to factors such as screen layout, graphics and the use of design principles such as symmetry and balance. In the context of multimedia design, Jennings [19] relates aesthetics (in this case media quality) to positive a↵ect and suggests that aesthetic experiences \textbf{promote focused attention and stimulate curiosity.} The significance of aesthetics was well demonstrated by Tractinsky \& Ikar [45] who, in an experiment in which users interacted with a computerised, surrogate Automated Teller Machine, found a positive correlation between \textbf{perceived usability} and aesthetic appeal, even though no such correlation existed between perceived usability and actual usability."

People remember enjoyable, useful, engaging experiences and want to repeat them. \textbf{This aspect of engagement refers to the likelihood of remembering an experience and the willingness to repeat it} [35]. It also relates to a users' willingness to recommend an experience to others, and to their perceptions of whether an experience met their expectations of being "successful", "rewarding", or "worthwhile" [29]. In the context of the web, \textbf{endurability can be related to the notion of 'sticky' content and the goal of holding the user's attention and encouraging them to return.} O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that having fun, being rewarded with convenience and incentives, and discovering something new promoted later re-engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

In e-commerce applications, shoppers can enjoy the experience of becoming sidetracked, browsing just to see what is there [28].

"Richness and control. The "Richness, Control and Engagement" (RC \& E) framework [37] explains levels of engagement in terms of the levels of richness and control that are shaped by the features of a product and the user's expertise.

Control captures the extent to which a person is able to achieve this growth potential by assessing the e↵ort in the selection and attainment of goals (clarity, ease, self confidence, freedom). Through experiments on a digital voicemail system, where they varied the number of features of the user interface, the amount of voicemail content and the type of task, Rozendaal et al.

Organisations in "real life" do rely on consumers' faith in the information or service provided. For example, telephone companies are required to correctly connect calls and protect the integrity of phone numbers. Similar requirements can be issued when transposing trust to the web.

Trust can also be related to engagement with web search services, where authoritativeness and popularity features are used to rank search results [20].

\par
"ubjective measures Where the subjective characteristics of an \textbf{interactive experience} have been defined, it is possible to construct a postexperience questionnaire to measure them in relation to a given interactive experience. Such an instrument was developed by O'Brian, Toms and colleagues. They first [28] report a literature review and exploratory interview study with users in four domains (online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting, and video games). Through their analysis they identify a set of attributes of user engagement (some of which are listed above). They then used this initial conceptualisation to develop a questionnaire to assess userengagement among online shoppers [29]. They administered their survey to 440 online shoppers and used factor analysis to reduce the characteristics to a set of key constructs. Their survey provides a standardised instrument for eliciting users engagement assessments. O'Brian et al's aim was to produce a general purpose user engagement questionnaire. However, user engagement almost certainly has di↵erent characteristics in di↵erent application domains and for di↵erent demographic groups. The web o↵ers a diversity of experiences relevant to a diversity of users. The properties of engagement during instant messaging, for example, may di↵er from the properties of engagement with a news portal. Aesthetic appeal may be an important factor for engagement with a films website whilst trust has been found to be a key factor in engagement with health websites [50]. Related to this, di↵erent user populations may have di↵erent priorities. Whereas fun may be an important characteristic for engaging children [35], ease of navigation may be a higher priority for adults. Some characteristics of engagement may generalise well, others may not." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

These include their reliance on the user's subjectivity [42], post-hoc interpretation and their susceptibility to the halo e↵ect1 [38]. A common strategy to overcome these is to develop objective measures that can reliably indicate subjective states [16].

"This raises the question of what objective phenomena are indicative of engagement. To date little has been reported on this, but since engagement is multifaceted and complex, a number of di↵erent variables may be useful to measure. In the following we discuss some measures used in previous research. What becomes evident is that each objective measure tend to target a very specific aspect of engagement, unlike questionnaires, which can address a range of variables. In light of this and our proposal that di↵erent engagement characteristics are relevant for di↵erent kinds of situation, we anticipate that it will be both useful and necessary to establish a range of objective measures and use this range to predict engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

Despite its name, we regard SPT as an objective measure given that it is assessed against actual time. To ask somebody to report how long an activity has lasted or estimate an interval is to ask them a question they can get wrong (by di↵erent degrees). In a sense it is a measure of performance.

Examples of sensors are eye trackers (diculty, attention, fatigue, mental activity, strong emotion), mouse pressure (stress, certainty of response), biosensors (e.g. temperature for negative affect and relaxation, electrodermal for arousal, blood flow for stress and emotion intensity), oximiters (e.g., pulse), camera (e.g., face tracking for general emotion detection). Such sensors have several advantages over questionnaires or online behaviour, since they are more directly connected to the emotional state of the user, are more objective (involuntary body responses) and they are continuously measured. They are however more invasive and cannot be used in large scale studies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/5}{Attfield et al 2011:5})

"Ikehara and Crosby [15] have used such sensors to assess the cognitive load of a "game" (tracking fractions). Jennett et al. [18] also report the use eye-tracking data to assess immersion. They found that eye-movement increases over time during a non-immersed experience and reduces over time during an immersed experience. Users seem to focus on fewer targets during engaged attention. In general, such measures could be highly indicative of immersive states through their links with attention, a↵ect, the perception of aesthetics and novelty. Research is required to refine our understanding of precisely what physiological states are indicative of engagement and how to di↵erentiate against negative states of high arousal such as stress."

"A related approach can be found in the patent Methods and systems for detecting user satisfaction (US Patent 7587324) where the inventors propose to measure user satisfaction by assigning a utility value to each sequence of actions (between a user and a computer interface) and comparing this value to a baseline. User interaction patterns have also be used to predict search engine switching behaviour [49], which is a facet of user engagement. From a commercial perspective, assessments of online behaviour fall within the scope of customer engagement (CE). CE is an instrument of marketing referring to the engagement of customers with one another, with a company or a brand. Its more recent form considers online CE. Online CE enables organisations to respond to the changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as the increasing ine↵ectiveness of the traditional"interrupt and repeat"broadcast model of advertising. Supporting"deep"engagement is seen as an important source of competitive advantage, whether through advertising, user generated product reviews, FAQs, forums where consumers can socialise or contribute to product development. In this space, a number of initiatives have emerged to address the question of CE metrics from organisations such as the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and Nielsen Media Research. As in the academic literature, engagement is seen as multifaceted and open to a range of potential metrics [43]. Information retrieval (IR) metrics. Among the di↵erent lines of research in IR metrics, three are directly related to measuring user engagement. The first is to develop metrics for interactive IR, e.g., [5, 17] where users and their contexts are taken into account. This line has brought up the idea of simulated search scenarios, where a subject is asked to follow a search scenario that specifies what, why, and in which context the user is searching. The second line of research is to develop metrics that incorporate enriched user interaction models, e.g., [33, 21, 51]. This is needed when old assumptions typical of traditional IR (linear browsing, binary relevance) do not hold. The work of e.g. Piwowarski \& Dupret [33] and Kazai et al.

"Within the approach, we propose the following three main directions of work: (1) identification of interaction patterns and development of engagement measures for a range of contexts and services; (2) adaptation of immersion concepts from gaming; and (3) designing for user engagement. The first two lines of research try to define user engagement in various contexts, along with metrics and methodologies for measuring it. The third gives direct and practical means to deploying definitions, metrics and methodologies for designing engaging technologies. These lines of research are not independent from each other, but represent related aspects that will undoubtedly influence and inform the overall approach for defining and measuring user engagement. We elaborate on each in the next sections" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"Our goal is to define a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained, and, as an ultimate aim, lead to recommendations and guidelines for user interface and interaction design for front-end web technology. Our approach is holistic but convergent, following a general progression from: (i) Empirical and analytic exploration of the characteristics of user engagement (ii) Correlating and resolving these to integrated models and reliable measures both objective and subjective (iii) Design and validation of prototypes Within the approach, we propose the following three main directions of work: (1) identification of interaction patterns and development of engagement measures for a range of contexts and services; (2) adaptation of immersion concepts from gaming; and (3) designing for user engagement.

"Developing measures and models of user engagement The goal of the first line of investigation is to obtain an understanding of how a range of user engagement characteristics relate to specific user contexts and scenarios and how they can be calculated using state-of-the-art web analytic metrics, IR metrics, and existing or novel user engagement measures. This would expand on the work of O'Brian and colleagues at the University of Dalhousie [28, 29]. In our opinion, their work presents the most significant progress towards understanding and assessing user engagement to date." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"an important goal will be to derive reliable and reusable metrics for user engagement that are specific to particular contexts and online services. In order to do so, it is necessary to collect and catalogue existing and new engagement characteristics and indicators. Such characteristics can be tested for correlation with a range of existing measures, such as standard IR metrics for assessing web search engines and web analytics measures. This would involve setting up a series of "lab-based" user experiments (combinations of virtual, online lab experiments, actual lab environments, and in-situ studies) around specific user tasks and usage scenarios in which users' perceived values are studied for various characteristics through questionnaires and other subjective measures. Data would also be collected through observation and logging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"It is important that experiments are carried out on a sufficiently large and diverse sample of the user population and using a (feasibly) wide range of design variants, user tasks and motivations to ensure generalisability. To reduce bias, appropriate sampling methods with respect to the user population have to be used. Psychological techniques such as experience sampling2 (e.g., [8]) can be used to gain insights on user interactions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"From these experiments, dependency relationships can be established among the di↵erent engagement characteristics, leading to classes of user models for the di↵erent contexts and task types. A specific point of interest is the relationship between incentive structures, rewards, benefits and engagement. The derived user engagement models can then be validated through further experiments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"In order to assess the full range of variables of engagement, it is necessary to test a multitude of scenarios, interaction and graphics designs, for example, di↵erent page layouts, result presentations, modified user interaction models (such as result peek, scratch pad), etc. We anticipate the need for continuous refinement to this methodology, allowing fluid adaptation to the latest findings and the research questions that such results raise." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"Summarising, this line of research will deal with: (1) Classifying characteristics of user engagement as relevant to particular contexts, user tasks, and incentives, and in particular, validating characteristics relevant to web interactions (extending our current work); (2) Identifying whether characteristics can be automatically derived using standard or more advanced web analytic measures or IR metrics and developing prediction models when applicable; (3) Identifying patterns of user engagement (leading to the development of models of user engagement), both from qualitative (surveys, questionnaires, focus groups, participatory design, etc.) and quantitative points of view (through log analysis); (4) Developing from this a methodology for measuring and understanding user engagement, including methods for comparative measures across brands and methods for failure analysis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"New perspectives from immersion in gaming and related areas The goal of the second line of research is to develop novel concepts of user engagement through an examination of the notion of immersion as it is used in gaming." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"in a computer game involves being "drawn in", with attention focussed entirely on the game [18]. As such, this phenomenon has much in common with engagement and many ideas emerging from this and related research may be applicable to more general notions of user engagement and notions of user engagement on the web in particular. Some early work on the application of the concept of immersion is Bhatt's [3] preliminary study of interaction with a range of e-commerce web sites. Bhatt finds the relative importance of immersion (compared to interactivity and connectivity) to be genre-dependent; for example, it is far more significant to the fashion industry than it is to the financial industry. This finding concurs with our initial view of the applicability of immersion to user engagement and also the context dependant nature of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"In relation to immersion, of particular interest is the work of Cairns and colleagues. Their early work [6] reported a user study of immersion in gaming. They observed three progressively deeper levels of immersion, which they referred o as engagement, engrossment, and total immersion. In a" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})

"CEGE is a hierarchical model that elaborates a set of necessary conditions of an enjoyable gaming experience. For example, a positive experience depends on the user taking "ownership" of a game, where ownership involves developing high-level strategies and goals and receiving rewards. But this itself is built upon lowerlevel factors such as "control" elements (e.g., interface factors, small actions, point-of-view) and "facilitators" (such as time to play and the user's aesthetic values)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Calvillo-Gamez et al. [7] argue that many of these factors can be meaningfully extrapolated to other kinds of interaction, such as the use of productivity applications." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We propose further exploration of the concept of immersion and concepts from related domains (such as flow, and presence in Virtual Reality experiences) in order to expand and enrich existing notions of engagement. Underpinning this work will be the aim of expanding our understanding of the necessary constituents of an engaging experience. We believe that this can bring valuable new perspectives to the measurement of user engagement on the web. The expected outcomes are: (1) Understanding the links (and contrasts) between user engagement and immersion (and to some extent flow and presence); (2) Leveraging this understanding to enrich our model of user engagement; (3) Developing additional metrics relevant to search and di↵erent genres of web interaction; (4) Conceptual input into largerscale experimentation in tandem with the first line of work (Section 3.1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Designing for user engagement This last line of research explicitly focuses on designing for user engagement, by providing a useful source of validated design ideas. This is based on insights from the other two lines of research to inform the development, validation and refinement of design concepts (initiated in the first line of research - Section 3.1) for services and tools aimed at promoting user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"To conduct such a research, an iterative, user-centred design process incorporating evaluation throughout, should be adopted. Initial qualitative field studies can be used to identify and characterise particular kinds of interaction scenario" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"and their requirements. Scenarios should include individual interaction as well as collaboration, sharing and social interactions. Each scenario would provide a basis for developing conceptual designs, which implement generalisable strategies for promoting engagement appropriate to the context. Prototypes ranging from low to high-fidelity can be developed and evaluated iteratively, with early formative evaluations leading to the development of design improvements. Summative evaluations can then be used to assess design alternatives in terms of user engagement metrics developed in other areas of the work. Overall the process will be aimed at generating and testing generalisable design strategies for promoting engagement in di↵erent contexts, ultimately resulting in reusable recommendations, guidelines and exemplars which can be employed by other designers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"An approach to the cataloguing and communication of design strategies, which we favour, is to record these in the form of interaction design patterns [4]. Patterns are an approach to capturing reusable solutions to recurring design problems within semi-formal representations. As such they o↵er a convenient basis for generating a 'lingua franca' of design solutions that encapsulate a particular set of design values (in this case the promotion of engagement)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"The expected outcomes of this line of research are to: (1) Evaluate prototype solutions for promoting user engagement in a range of contexts; (2) Produce generalisable design recommendations in the form of reusable interaction design patterns." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})

"CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we advocate the development of an approach for studying, measuring, and explaining user engagement. We first define user engagement, and then report on and classify various characteristics and potential methods for measurement. User engagement is a multifaceted, and complex phenomenon; this applies to both its definition and empirically grounded "signature" characteristics. Both of these give rise to a number of potential approaches for measurement whether objectively or subjectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We proposed three lines of research that have the potential to shape what we like to refer as the science of user engagement. The first two define methodologies for measurement, whilst the third outlines how these methodologies can lead to user engagement aware front-end technology design." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Our proposed approach is motivated by the aim of achieving an innovative yet principled approach to the problems associated with measuring user engagement, building on existing solid and fundamental work and methodology, and taking inspiration from other related areas."

\textbf{Extracted Annotations (10/29/2017, 2:32:01 AM)}
\par
"User engagement is a key concept in designing user-centred web applications. It refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasises the positive aspects of the interaction, and in particular the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"This definition is motivated by the observation that successful technologies are not just used, but they are engaged with. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature to measure engagement, however, little has been done to validate and relate these measures and so provide a firm basis for assessing the quality of the user experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"Engagement is heavily influenced, for example, by the user interface and its associated process flow, the user's context, value system and incentives. In this paper we propose an approach to relating and developing unified measures of user engagement. Our ultimate aim is to define a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained, leading to recommendations and guidelines for user interface and interaction design for front-end web technology. Towards this aim, in this paper, we consider how existing user engagement metrics, web analytics, information retrieval metrics, and measures from immersion in gaming can bring new perspective to defining, measuring and explaining user engagement."

\par
"computers and connectivity have come to pervade all aspects of our lives. We have computers in our homes and in our pockets. The continually evolving web provides unprecedented choice of things we can do; we can educate ourselves or others, buy and sell, watch movies, keep up with friends, write blogs, share content, play games, or simply indulge a passing curiosity. With this the conceptualisation of the user has also changed. Kuutti [23] describes this evolution as being from a cog in an organisational machine and a "source of error", to a partner in social interaction and ultimately consumer, and more recently, with Web 2.0, to content creator." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"In line with this transformation, researchers and practitioners in user-centred design have increasingly seen the need to extend traditional performance-based notions of usability, such as e↵ectiveness, eciency and satisfaction (ISO 9241-11), to encompass non-utilitarian aspects of interaction (e.g., [12, 24]). Under the broad rubric of user experience, there is emphasis on understanding and designing for the subjective aspects of technology encounters (e.g., [24, 47])." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"In a world full of choices where the fleeting attention of the user becomes a prime resource, it is essential that technology providers do not just design systems but that they design engaging experiences [31]. Indeed, in an environment of choice, failing to engage the user "equates with no sale on an electronic commerce site and no transmission of information from a website; people go elsewhere" [28]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"The question then becomes: how do we do this, and closely related to that, how do weassess the experience as being the kind we would like to design" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"The answer lies in the study of user engagement, a quality of user experience that emphasises the positive aspects of interaction, and in particular the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology (and so being motivated to use it) [28]. Successful technologies are not just used, they are engaged with; users invest time, attention, and emotion into the equation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"To promote user engagement we need to be able to design for it. To know when we have done this we need some way of assessing and measuring it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"Only by knowing when and why engagement occurs can we understand what is e↵ective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"As discussed in this paper, many works on user engagement have been written, but they are spread over a range of different areas of research, thus hindering the possibility of building upon previous research. We thus need a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured and explained, leading to, for example, recommendations and" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"guidelines for user interface and interaction design, that is, we need a science of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Towards this goal, this paper contains our proposal to establish the "science of user engagement". It has two main contributions. First, we provide a review and classification of prior research on user engagement and associated measures (Section 2), with a special focus on the work carried out outside large-scale web log analysis" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Based on this review, and our insights, we then present our proposed research agenda providing a detailed roadmap on how to define and set up a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"USER ENGAGEMENT IN THE LITERATURE In this section, we provide a review of prior research on user engagement. We start with our own definition based on our review of that literature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"User engagement is the emotional, cognitive and behavioural connection that exists, at any point in time and possibly over time, between a user and a resource." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"This definition is intentionally broad. By identifying emotional, cognitive, and behavioural factors, it emphasises the holistic character of user engagement and is also suggestive of aspects that are open to measurement. It also refers equally to user engagement in terms of a single session or a more long-term relationship across multiple session. User engagement with a technological resource is not just about how a single interaction unfolds, but about how and why people develop a relationship with technology and integrate it into their lives." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Characteristics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"In the following we discuss some characteristics associated with user engagement, either as presented by previous studies or as suggested by us." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"These elaborate the notion of engagement over the three broad dimensions: emotional, cognitive and behavioural. While some of the characteristics have stronger ties with one of the dimensions, most are a combination of the three." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"They also provide some orientation for thinking about the designable causes and observable consequences of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Focused attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Focused attention. Being engaged in an experience involves focusing attention to the exclusion of other things, including other people (unless social interaction enhances the engagement) [28]. This phenomenon relates to distortions in the subjective perception of time during interaction [29], which has been shown to be an e↵ective indicator of cognitive involvement [2] and has been used as a component in measures of games immersion [18]. The more engaged someone is, the more likely they are to underestimate the passage of time. Together with concentration, absorption and loss of self-consciousness, distortions in the subjective perception of time have led to parallels being drawn between engagement and the idea of flow as an optimal experience [9], where flow refers to a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in what they are doing."

"Positive A↵ect. "Engaged users are a↵ectively involved" [28]. A↵ect relates to the emotions experienced during interaction. For example, O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that a lack of fun can act as a barrier to shopping online and that fun during a webcast can draw the user in, although a lack of awareness of other viewers can mitigate against the quality of the fun experience. Jennings [19] argues that a↵ective experiences are intrinsically motivating and that, in relation to engagement on the web, an initial a↵ective hook can induce a desire for exploration or active discovery. This, they argue then encourages greater emotional involvement and contributes to customer loyalty (see endurability below). They regard affect as"an emotional investment that helps create a personal link to an experience or activity" [19]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

"Aesthetics. Aesthetics concerns the sensory, visual appeal of an interface and is seen as an important factor for engagement [29]. In the context of online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting and video games, O'Brian \& Toms [28] relate aesthetics to factors such as screen layout, graphics and the use of design principles such as symmetry and balance. In the context of multimedia design, Jennings [19] relates aesthetics (in this case media quality) to positive a↵ect and suggests that aesthetic experiences promote focused attention and stimulate curiosity. The significance of aesthetics was well demonstrated by Tractinsky \& Ikar [45] who, in an experiment in which users interacted with a computerised, surrogate Automated Teller Machine, found a positive correlation between perceived usability and aesthetic appeal, even though no such correlation existed between perceived usability and actual usability."

"Endurability. People remember enjoyable, useful, engaging experiences and want to repeat them. This aspect of engagement refers to the likelihood of remembering an experience and the willingness to repeat it [35]. It also relates to a users' willingness to recommend an experience to others, and to their perceptions of whether an experience met their expectations of being "successful", "rewarding", or "worthwhile" [29]. In the context of the web, endurability can be related to the notion of 'sticky' content and the goal of holding the user's attention and encouraging them to return. O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that having fun, being rewarded with convenience and incentives, and discovering something new promoted later re-engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

"Novelty. Interactive experiences can be engaging because they present users with novel, surprising, unfamiliar or unexpected experiences. Novelty appeals to our sense of curiosity, encourages inquisitive behaviour and promotes repeated engagement [29]. It can arise through freshness of content or innovation in information technology [13]. In e-commerce applications, shoppers can enjoy the experience of becoming sidetracked, browsing just to see what is there [28]. It has been shown that learners experience higher levels of engagement during multimedia presentations that exhibit higher levels of variety [48]. However, there is also suggestion of the importance of a subtle balance between novelty on the one hand and familiarity on the other.

"Richness and control. The "Richness, Control and Engagement" (RC \& E) framework [37] explains levels of engagement in terms of the levels of richness and control that are shaped by the features of a product and the user's expertise. Richness captures the growth potential of an activity by assessing the variety and complexity of thoughts, actions and perceptions as evoked during the activity (e.g., variety, possibilities, enjoyment, excitement, challenge). Control captures the extent to which a person is able to achieve this growth potential by assessing the e↵ort in the selection and attainment of goals (clarity, ease, self confidence, freedom). Through experiments on a digital voicemail system, where they varied the number of features of the user interface, the amount of voicemail content and the type of task, Rozendaal et al.

Trust is not only a matter of the insurances o↵ered by technology (e.g. encrypted communications), but also depends on implicit contracts between people, computers, and organisations [22]. Organisations in "real life" do rely on consumers' faith in the information or service provided. For example, telephone companies are required to correctly connect calls and protect the integrity of phone numbers. Similar requirements can be issued when transposing trust to the web.

Similarly, the perceived fairness of the scoring system in Q\&A sites influences users' trust in the service and their willingness to engage [44]. In social networks, trust naturally has an additional dimension related to the perception of trustworthiness of user-generated content [10]. Trust can also be related to engagement with web search services, where authoritativeness and popularity features are used to rank search results [20]. Finally, a consequence of trust or reputation is expectation, which harnesses engagement before a user has even reached a web site [41]."

\par
"ubjective measures Where the subjective characteristics of an interactive experience have been defined, it is possible to construct a postexperience questionnaire to measure them in relation to a given interactive experience. Such an instrument was developed by O'Brian, Toms and colleagues. They first [28] report a literature review and exploratory interview study with users in four domains (online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting, and video games). Through their analysis they identify a set of attributes of user engagement (some of which are listed above). They then used this initial conceptualisation to develop a questionnaire to assess userengagement among online shoppers [29]. They administered their survey to 440 online shoppers and used factor analysis to reduce the characteristics to a set of key constructs. Their survey provides a standardised instrument for eliciting users engagement assessments. O'Brian et al's aim was to produce a general purpose user engagement questionnaire. However, user engagement almost certainly has di↵erent characteristics in di↵erent application domains and for di↵erent demographic groups. The web o↵ers a diversity of experiences relevant to a diversity of users. The properties of engagement during instant messaging, for example, may di↵er from the properties of engagement with a news portal. Aesthetic appeal may be an important factor for engagement with a films website whilst trust has been found to be a key factor in engagement with health websites [50]. Related to this, di↵erent user populations may have di↵erent priorities. Whereas fun may be an important characteristic for engaging children [35], ease of navigation may be a higher priority for adults. Some characteristics of engagement may generalise well, others may not." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

"This raises the question of what objective phenomena are indicative of engagement. To date little has been reported on this, but since engagement is multifaceted and complex, a number of di↵erent variables may be useful to measure. In the following we discuss some measures used in previous research. What becomes evident is that each objective measure tend to target a very specific aspect of engagement, unlike questionnaires, which can address a range of variables. In light of this and our proposal that di↵erent engagement characteristics are relevant for di↵erent kinds of situation, we anticipate that it will be both useful and necessary to establish a range of objective measures and use this range to predict engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

Despite its name, we regard SPT as an objective measure given that it is assessed against actual time. To ask somebody to report how long an activity has lasted or estimate an interval is to ask them a question they can get wrong (by di↵erent degrees). In a sense it is a measure of performance.

"Physiological data can be captured by a broad range of sensors [15] related to di↵erent cognitive states. Examples of sensors are eye trackers (diculty, attention, fatigue, mental activity, strong emotion), mouse pressure (stress, certainty of response), biosensors (e.g. temperature for negative affect and relaxation, electrodermal for arousal, blood flow for stress and emotion intensity), oximiters (e.g., pulse), camera (e.g., face tracking for general emotion detection). Such sensors have several advantages over questionnaires or online behaviour, since they are more directly connected to the emotional state of the user, are more objective (involuntary body responses) and they are continuously measured. They are however more invasive and cannot be used in large scale studies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/5}{Attfield et al 2011:5})
\par
"Ikehara and Crosby [15] have used such sensors to assess the cognitive load of a "game" (tracking fractions). Jennett et al. [18] also report the use eye-tracking data to assess immersion. They found that eye-movement increases over time during a non-immersed experience and reduces over time during an immersed experience. Users seem to focus on fewer targets during engaged attention. In general, such measures could be highly indicative of immersive states through their links with attention, a↵ect, the perception of aesthetics and novelty. Research is required to refine our understanding of precisely what physiological states are indicative of engagement and how to di↵erentiate against negative states of high arousal such as stress."

"A related approach can be found in the patent Methods and systems for detecting user satisfaction (US Patent 7587324) where the inventors propose to measure user satisfaction by assigning a utility value to each sequence of actions (between a user and a computer interface) and comparing this value to a baseline. User interaction patterns have also be used to predict search engine switching behaviour [49], which is a facet of user engagement. From a commercial perspective, assessments of online behaviour fall within the scope of customer engagement (CE). CE is an instrument of marketing referring to the engagement of customers with one another, with a company or a brand. Its more recent form considers online CE. Online CE enables organisations to respond to the changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as the increasing ine↵ectiveness of the traditional"interrupt and repeat"broadcast model of advertising. Supporting"deep"engagement is seen as an important source of competitive advantage, whether through advertising, user generated product reviews, FAQs, forums where consumers can socialise or contribute to product development. In this space, a number of initiatives have emerged to address the question of CE metrics from organisations such as the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and Nielsen Media Research. As in the academic literature, engagement is seen as multifaceted and open to a range of potential metrics [43]. Information retrieval (IR) metrics. Among the di↵erent lines of research in IR metrics, three are directly related to measuring user engagement. The first is to develop metrics for interactive IR, e.g., [5, 17] where users and their contexts are taken into account. This line has brought up the idea of simulated search scenarios, where a subject is asked to follow a search scenario that specifies what, why, and in which context the user is searching. The second line of research is to develop metrics that incorporate enriched user interaction models, e.g., [33, 21, 51]. This is needed when old assumptions typical of traditional IR (linear browsing, binary relevance) do not hold. The work of e.g. Piwowarski \& Dupret [33] and Kazai et al.

"Within the approach, we propose the following three main directions of work: (1) identification of interaction patterns and development of engagement measures for a range of contexts and services; (2) adaptation of immersion concepts from gaming; and (3) designing for user engagement. The first two lines of research try to define user engagement in various contexts, along with metrics and methodologies for measuring it. The third gives direct and practical means to deploying definitions, metrics and methodologies for designing engaging technologies. These lines of research are not independent from each other, but represent related aspects that will undoubtedly influence and inform the overall approach for defining and measuring user engagement. We elaborate on each in the next sections" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"Our goal is to define a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained, and, as an ultimate aim, lead to recommendations and guidelines for user interface and interaction design for front-end web technology. Our approach is holistic but convergent, following a general progression from: (i) Empirical and analytic exploration of the characteristics of user engagement (ii) Correlating and resolving these to integrated models and reliable measures both objective and subjective (iii) Design and validation of prototypes Within the approach, we propose the following three main directions of work: (1) identification of interaction patterns and development of engagement measures for a range of contexts and services; (2) adaptation of immersion concepts from gaming; and (3) designing for user engagement.

"Developing measures and models of user engagement The goal of the first line of investigation is to obtain an understanding of how a range of user engagement characteristics relate to specific user contexts and scenarios and how they can be calculated using state-of-the-art web analytic metrics, IR metrics, and existing or novel user engagement measures. This would expand on the work of O'Brian and colleagues at the University of Dalhousie [28, 29]. In our opinion, their work presents the most significant progress towards understanding and assessing user engagement to date." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"an important goal will be to derive reliable and reusable metrics for user engagement that are specific to particular contexts and online services. In order to do so, it is necessary to collect and catalogue existing and new engagement characteristics and indicators. Such characteristics can be tested for correlation with a range of existing measures, such as standard IR metrics for assessing web search engines and web analytics measures. This would involve setting up a series of "lab-based" user experiments (combinations of virtual, online lab experiments, actual lab environments, and in-situ studies) around specific user tasks and usage scenarios in which users' perceived values are studied for various characteristics through questionnaires and other subjective measures. Data would also be collected through observation and logging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"It is important that experiments are carried out on a sufficiently large and diverse sample of the user population and using a (feasibly) wide range of design variants, user tasks and motivations to ensure generalisability. To reduce bias, appropriate sampling methods with respect to the user population have to be used. Psychological techniques such as experience sampling2 (e.g., [8]) can be used to gain insights on user interactions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"From these experiments, dependency relationships can be established among the di↵erent engagement characteristics, leading to classes of user models for the di↵erent contexts and task types. A specific point of interest is the relationship between incentive structures, rewards, benefits and engagement. The derived user engagement models can then be validated through further experiments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"In order to assess the full range of variables of engagement, it is necessary to test a multitude of scenarios, interaction and graphics designs, for example, di↵erent page layouts, result presentations, modified user interaction models (such as result peek, scratch pad), etc. We anticipate the need for continuous refinement to this methodology, allowing fluid adaptation to the latest findings and the research questions that such results raise." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"Summarising, this line of research will deal with: (1) Classifying characteristics of user engagement as relevant to particular contexts, user tasks, and incentives, and in particular, validating characteristics relevant to web interactions (extending our current work); (2) Identifying whether characteristics can be automatically derived using standard or more advanced web analytic measures or IR metrics and developing prediction models when applicable; (3) Identifying patterns of user engagement (leading to the development of models of user engagement), both from qualitative (surveys, questionnaires, focus groups, participatory design, etc.) and quantitative points of view (through log analysis); (4) Developing from this a methodology for measuring and understanding user engagement, including methods for comparative measures across brands and methods for failure analysis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"New perspectives from immersion in gaming and related areas The goal of the second line of research is to develop novel concepts of user engagement through an examination of the notion of immersion as it is used in gaming." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"in a computer game involves being "drawn in", with attention focussed entirely on the game [18]. As such, this phenomenon has much in common with engagement and many ideas emerging from this and related research may be applicable to more general notions of user engagement and notions of user engagement on the web in particular. Some early work on the application of the concept of immersion is Bhatt's [3] preliminary study of interaction with a range of e-commerce web sites. Bhatt finds the relative importance of immersion (compared to interactivity and connectivity) to be genre-dependent; for example, it is far more significant to the fashion industry than it is to the financial industry. This finding concurs with our initial view of the applicability of immersion to user engagement and also the context dependant nature of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"In relation to immersion, of particular interest is the work of Cairns and colleagues. Their early work [6] reported a user study of immersion in gaming. They observed three progressively deeper levels of immersion, which they referred o as engagement, engrossment, and total immersion. In a" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})

"CEGE is a hierarchical model that elaborates a set of necessary conditions of an enjoyable gaming experience. For example, a positive experience depends on the user taking "ownership" of a game, where ownership involves developing high-level strategies and goals and receiving rewards. But this itself is built upon lowerlevel factors such as "control" elements (e.g., interface factors, small actions, point-of-view) and "facilitators" (such as time to play and the user's aesthetic values)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Calvillo-Gamez et al. [7] argue that many of these factors can be meaningfully extrapolated to other kinds of interaction, such as the use of productivity applications." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We propose further exploration of the concept of immersion and concepts from related domains (such as flow, and presence in Virtual Reality experiences) in order to expand and enrich existing notions of engagement. Underpinning this work will be the aim of expanding our understanding of the necessary constituents of an engaging experience. We believe that this can bring valuable new perspectives to the measurement of user engagement on the web. The expected outcomes are: (1) Understanding the links (and contrasts) between user engagement and immersion (and to some extent flow and presence); (2) Leveraging this understanding to enrich our model of user engagement; (3) Developing additional metrics relevant to search and di↵erent genres of web interaction; (4) Conceptual input into largerscale experimentation in tandem with the first line of work (Section 3.1)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Designing for user engagement This last line of research explicitly focuses on designing for user engagement, by providing a useful source of validated design ideas. This is based on insights from the other two lines of research to inform the development, validation and refinement of design concepts (initiated in the first line of research - Section 3.1) for services and tools aimed at promoting user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"To conduct such a research, an iterative, user-centred design process incorporating evaluation throughout, should be adopted. Initial qualitative field studies can be used to identify and characterise particular kinds of interaction scenario" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"and their requirements. Scenarios should include individual interaction as well as collaboration, sharing and social interactions. Each scenario would provide a basis for developing conceptual designs, which implement generalisable strategies for promoting engagement appropriate to the context. Prototypes ranging from low to high-fidelity can be developed and evaluated iteratively, with early formative evaluations leading to the development of design improvements. Summative evaluations can then be used to assess design alternatives in terms of user engagement metrics developed in other areas of the work. Overall the process will be aimed at generating and testing generalisable design strategies for promoting engagement in di↵erent contexts, ultimately resulting in reusable recommendations, guidelines and exemplars which can be employed by other designers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"An approach to the cataloguing and communication of design strategies, which we favour, is to record these in the form of interaction design patterns [4]. Patterns are an approach to capturing reusable solutions to recurring design problems within semi-formal representations. As such they o↵er a convenient basis for generating a 'lingua franca' of design solutions that encapsulate a particular set of design values (in this case the promotion of engagement)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"The expected outcomes of this line of research are to: (1) Evaluate prototype solutions for promoting user engagement in a range of contexts; (2) Produce generalisable design recommendations in the form of reusable interaction design patterns." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})

"CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we advocate the development of an approach for studying, measuring, and explaining user engagement. We first define user engagement, and then report on and classify various characteristics and potential methods for measurement. User engagement is a multifaceted, and complex phenomenon; this applies to both its definition and empirically grounded "signature" characteristics. Both of these give rise to a number of potential approaches for measurement whether objectively or subjectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We proposed three lines of research that have the potential to shape what we like to refer as the science of user engagement. The first two define methodologies for measurement, whilst the third outlines how these methodologies can lead to user engagement aware front-end technology design." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Our proposed approach is motivated by the aim of achieving an innovative yet principled approach to the problems associated with measuring user engagement, building on existing solid and fundamental work and methodology, and taking inspiration from other related areas."

\textbf{Extracted Annotations (11/10/2017, 1:10:58 AM)}
\par
"User engagement is a key concept in designing user-centred web applications. It refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasises the positive aspects of the interaction, and in particular the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"This definition is motivated by the observation that successful technologies are not just used, but they are engaged with. Numerous methods have been proposed in the literature to measure engagement, however, little has been done to validate and relate these measures and so provide a firm basis for assessing the quality of the user experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"Engagement is heavily influenced, for example, by the user interface and its associated process flow, the user's context, value system and incentives. In this paper we propose an approach to relating and developing unified measures of user engagement. Our ultimate aim is to define a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained, leading to recommendations and guidelines for user interface and interaction design for front-end web technology. Towards this aim, in this paper, we consider how existing user engagement metrics, web analytics, information retrieval metrics, and measures from immersion in gaming can bring new perspective to defining, measuring and explaining user engagement."

\par
"computers and connectivity have come to pervade all aspects of our lives. We have computers in our homes and in our pockets. The continually evolving web provides unprecedented choice of things we can do; we can educate ourselves or others, buy and sell, watch movies, keep up with friends, write blogs, share content, play games, or simply indulge a passing curiosity. With this the conceptualisation of the user has also changed. Kuutti [23] describes this evolution as being from a cog in an organisational machine and a "source of error", to a partner in social interaction and ultimately consumer, and more recently, with Web 2.0, to content creator." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"In line with this transformation, researchers and practitioners in user-centred design have increasingly seen the need to extend traditional performance-based notions of usability, such as e↵ectiveness, eciency and satisfaction (ISO 9241-11), to encompass non-utilitarian aspects of interaction (e.g., [12, 24]). Under the broad rubric of user experience, there is emphasis on understanding and designing for the subjective aspects of technology encounters (e.g., [24, 47])." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"In a world full of choices where the fleeting attention of the user becomes a prime resource, it is essential that technology providers do not just design systems but that they design engaging experiences [31]. Indeed, in an environment of choice, failing to engage the user "equates with no sale on an electronic commerce site and no transmission of information from a website; people go elsewhere" [28]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"The question then becomes: how do we do this, and closely related to that, how do weassess the experience as being the kind we would like to design" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"The answer lies in the study of user engagement, a quality of user experience that emphasises the positive aspects of interaction, and in particular the phenomena associated with being captivated by technology (and so being motivated to use it) [28]. Successful technologies are not just used, they are engaged with; users invest time, attention, and emotion into the equation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"To promote user engagement we need to be able to design for it. To know when we have done this we need some way of assessing and measuring it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"Only by knowing when and why engagement occurs can we understand what is e↵ective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"As discussed in this paper, many works on user engagement have been written, but they are spread over a range of different areas of research, thus hindering the possibility of building upon previous research. We thus need a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured and explained, leading to, for example, recommendations and" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/1}{Attfield et al 2011:1})
\par
"guidelines for user interface and interaction design, that is, we need a science of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Towards this goal, this paper contains our proposal to establish the "science of user engagement". It has two main contributions. First, we provide a review and classification of prior research on user engagement and associated measures (Section 2), with a special focus on the work carried out outside large-scale web log analysis" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Based on this review, and our insights, we then present our proposed research agenda providing a detailed roadmap on how to define and set up a framework in which user engagement can be studied, measured, and explained" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"USER ENGAGEMENT IN THE LITERATURE In this section, we provide a review of prior research on user engagement. We start with our own definition based on our review of that literature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"User engagement is the emotional, cognitive and behavioural connection that exists, at any point in time and possibly over time, between a user and a resource." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"This definition is intentionally broad. By identifying emotional, cognitive, and behavioural factors, it emphasises the holistic character of user engagement and is also suggestive of aspects that are open to measurement. It also refers equally to user engagement in terms of a single session or a more long-term relationship across multiple session. User engagement with a technological resource is not just about how a single interaction unfolds, but about how and why people develop a relationship with technology and integrate it into their lives." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Characteristics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"In the following we discuss some characteristics associated with user engagement, either as presented by previous studies or as suggested by us." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"These elaborate the notion of engagement over the three broad dimensions: emotional, cognitive and behavioural. While some of the characteristics have stronger ties with one of the dimensions, most are a combination of the three." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"They also provide some orientation for thinking about the designable causes and observable consequences of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Focused attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})
\par
"Focused attention. Being engaged in an experience involves focusing attention to the exclusion of other things, including other people (unless social interaction enhances the engagement) [28]. This phenomenon relates to distortions in the subjective perception of time during interaction [29], which has been shown to be an e↵ective indicator of cognitive involvement [2] and has been used as a component in measures of games immersion [18]. The more engaged someone is, the more likely they are to underestimate the passage of time. Together with concentration, absorption and loss of self-consciousness, distortions in the subjective perception of time have led to parallels being drawn between engagement and the idea of flow as an optimal experience [9], where flow refers to a mental state in which a person is fully immersed in what they are doing."

"Positive A↵ect. "Engaged users are a↵ectively involved" [28]. A↵ect relates to the emotions experienced during interaction. For example, O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that a lack of fun can act as a barrier to shopping online and that fun during a webcast can draw the user in, although a lack of awareness of other viewers can mitigate against the quality of the fun experience. Jennings [19] argues that a↵ective experiences are intrinsically motivating and that, in relation to engagement on the web, an initial a↵ective hook can induce a desire for exploration or active discovery. This, they argue then encourages greater emotional involvement and contributes to customer loyalty (see endurability below). They regard affect as"an emotional investment that helps create a personal link to an experience or activity" [19]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

"Aesthetics. Aesthetics concerns the sensory, visual appeal of an interface and is seen as an important factor for engagement [29]. In the context of online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting and video games, O'Brian \& Toms [28] relate aesthetics to factors such as screen layout, graphics and the use of design principles such as symmetry and balance. In the context of multimedia design, Jennings [19] relates aesthetics (in this case media quality) to positive a↵ect and suggests that aesthetic experiences promote focused attention and stimulate curiosity. The significance of aesthetics was well demonstrated by Tractinsky \& Ikar [45] who, in an experiment in which users interacted with a computerised, surrogate Automated Teller Machine, found a positive correlation between perceived usability and aesthetic appeal, even though no such correlation existed between perceived usability and actual usability."

"Endurability. People remember enjoyable, useful, engaging experiences and want to repeat them. This aspect of engagement refers to the likelihood of remembering an experience and the willingness to repeat it [35]. It also relates to a users' willingness to recommend an experience to others, and to their perceptions of whether an experience met their expectations of being "successful", "rewarding", or "worthwhile" [29]. In the context of the web, endurability can be related to the notion of 'sticky' content and the goal of holding the user's attention and encouraging them to return. O'Brian \& Toms [28] found that having fun, being rewarded with convenience and incentives, and discovering something new promoted later re-engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/2}{Attfield et al 2011:2})

"Novelty. Interactive experiences can be engaging because they present users with novel, surprising, unfamiliar or unexpected experiences. Novelty appeals to our sense of curiosity, encourages inquisitive behaviour and promotes repeated engagement [29]. It can arise through freshness of content or innovation in information technology [13]. In e-commerce applications, shoppers can enjoy the experience of becoming sidetracked, browsing just to see what is there [28]. It has been shown that learners experience higher levels of engagement during multimedia presentations that exhibit higher levels of variety [48]. However, there is also suggestion of the importance of a subtle balance between novelty on the one hand and familiarity on the other.

"Richness and control. The "Richness, Control and Engagement" (RC \& E) framework [37] explains levels of engagement in terms of the levels of richness and control that are shaped by the features of a product and the user's expertise. Richness captures the growth potential of an activity by assessing the variety and complexity of thoughts, actions and perceptions as evoked during the activity (e.g., variety, possibilities, enjoyment, excitement, challenge). Control captures the extent to which a person is able to achieve this growth potential by assessing the e↵ort in the selection and attainment of goals (clarity, ease, self confidence, freedom). Through experiments on a digital voicemail system, where they varied the number of features of the user interface, the amount of voicemail content and the type of task, Rozendaal et al.

Trust is not only a matter of the insurances o↵ered by technology (e.g. encrypted communications), but also depends on implicit contracts between people, computers, and organisations [22]. Organisations in "real life" do rely on consumers' faith in the information or service provided. For example, telephone companies are required to correctly connect calls and protect the integrity of phone numbers. Similar requirements can be issued when transposing trust to the web.

Similarly, the perceived fairness of the scoring system in Q\&A sites influences users' trust in the service and their willingness to engage [44]. In social networks, trust naturally has an additional dimension related to the perception of trustworthiness of user-generated content [10]. Trust can also be related to engagement with web search services, where authoritativeness and popularity features are used to rank search results [20]. Finally, a consequence of trust or reputation is expectation, which harnesses engagement before a user has even reached a web site [41]."

\par
"ubjective measures Where the subjective characteristics of an interactive experience have been defined, it is possible to construct a postexperience questionnaire to measure them in relation to a given interactive experience. Such an instrument was developed by O'Brian, Toms and colleagues. They first [28] report a literature review and exploratory interview study with users in four domains (online shopping, web searching, educational webcasting, and video games). Through their analysis they identify a set of attributes of user engagement (some of which are listed above). They then used this initial conceptualisation to develop a questionnaire to assess userengagement among online shoppers [29]. They administered their survey to 440 online shoppers and used factor analysis to reduce the characteristics to a set of key constructs. Their survey provides a standardised instrument for eliciting users engagement assessments. O'Brian et al's aim was to produce a general purpose user engagement questionnaire. However, user engagement almost certainly has di↵erent characteristics in di↵erent application domains and for di↵erent demographic groups. The web o↵ers a diversity of experiences relevant to a diversity of users. The properties of engagement during instant messaging, for example, may di↵er from the properties of engagement with a news portal. Aesthetic appeal may be an important factor for engagement with a films website whilst trust has been found to be a key factor in engagement with health websites [50]. Related to this, di↵erent user populations may have di↵erent priorities. Whereas fun may be an important characteristic for engaging children [35], ease of navigation may be a higher priority for adults. Some characteristics of engagement may generalise well, others may not." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

These include their reliance on the user's subjectivity [42], post-hoc interpretation and their susceptibility to the halo e↵ect1 [38]. A common strategy to overcome these is to develop objective measures that can reliably indicate subjective states [16].

"This raises the question of what objective phenomena are indicative of engagement. To date little has been reported on this, but since engagement is multifaceted and complex, a number of di↵erent variables may be useful to measure. In the following we discuss some measures used in previous research. What becomes evident is that each objective measure tend to target a very specific aspect of engagement, unlike questionnaires, which can address a range of variables. In light of this and our proposal that di↵erent engagement characteristics are relevant for di↵erent kinds of situation, we anticipate that it will be both useful and necessary to establish a range of objective measures and use this range to predict engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/4}{Attfield et al 2011:4})

Despite its name, we regard SPT as an objective measure given that it is assessed against actual time. To ask somebody to report how long an activity has lasted or estimate an interval is to ask them a question they can get wrong (by di↵erent degrees). In a sense it is a measure of performance.

"Physiological data can be captured by a broad range of sensors [15] related to di↵erent cognitive states. Examples of sensors are eye trackers (diculty, attention, fatigue, mental activity, strong emotion), mouse pressure (stress, certainty of response), biosensors (e.g. temperature for negative affect and relaxation, electrodermal for arousal, blood flow for stress and emotion intensity), oximiters (e.g., pulse), camera (e.g., face tracking for general emotion detection). Such sensors have several advantages over questionnaires or online behaviour, since they are more directly connected to the emotional state of the user, are more objective (involuntary body responses) and they are continuously measured. They are however more invasive and cannot be used in large scale studies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/5}{Attfield et al 2011:5})
\par
"Ikehara and Crosby [15] have used such sensors to assess the cognitive load of a "game" (tracking fractions). Jennett et al. [18] also report the use eye-tracking data to assess immersion. They found that eye-movement increases over time during a non-immersed experience and reduces over time during an immersed experience. Users seem to focus on fewer targets during engaged attention. In general, such measures could be highly indicative of immersive states through their links with attention, a↵ect, the perception of aesthetics and novelty. Research is required to refine our understanding of precisely what physiological states are indicative of engagement and how to di↵erentiate against negative states of high arousal such as stress."

"A related approach can be found in the patent Methods and systems for detecting user satisfaction (US Patent 7587324) where the inventors propose to measure user satisfaction by assigning a utility value to each sequence of actions (between a user and a computer interface) and comparing this value to a baseline. User interaction patterns have also be used to predict search engine switching behaviour [49], which is a facet of user engagement. From a commercial perspective, assessments of online behaviour fall within the scope of customer engagement (CE). CE is an instrument of marketing referring to the engagement of customers with one another, with a company or a brand. Its more recent form considers online CE. Online CE enables organisations to respond to the changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as the increasing ine↵ectiveness of the traditional"interrupt and repeat"broadcast model of advertising. Supporting"deep"engagement is seen as an important source of competitive advantage, whether through advertising, user generated product reviews, FAQs, forums where consumers can socialise or contribute to product development. In this space, a number of initiatives have emerged to address the question of CE metrics from organisations such as the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), the Association of National Advertisers (ANA) and Nielsen Media Research. As in the academic literature, engagement is seen as multifaceted and open to a range of potential metrics [43]. Information retrieval (IR) metrics. Among the di↵erent lines of research in IR metrics, three are directly related to measuring user engagement. The first is to develop metrics for interactive IR, e.g., [5, 17] where users and their contexts are taken into account. This line has brought up the idea of simulated search scenarios, where a subject is asked to follow a search scenario that specifies what, why, and in which context the user is searching. The second line of research is to develop metrics that incorporate enriched user interaction models, e.g., [33, 21, 51]. This is needed when old assumptions typical of traditional IR (linear browsing, binary relevance) do not hold. The work of e.g. Piwowarski \& Dupret [33] and Kazai et al.

"Developing measures and models of user engagement The goal of the first line of investigation is to obtain an understanding of how a range of user engagement characteristics relate to specific user contexts and scenarios and how they can be calculated using state-of-the-art web analytic metrics, IR metrics, and existing or novel user engagement measures. This would expand on the work of O'Brian and colleagues at the University of Dalhousie [28, 29]. In our opinion, their work presents the most significant progress towards understanding and assessing user engagement to date." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"an important goal will be to derive reliable and reusable metrics for user engagement that are specific to particular contexts and online services. In order to do so, it is necessary to collect and catalogue existing and new engagement characteristics and indicators. Such characteristics can be tested for correlation with a range of existing measures, such as standard IR metrics for assessing web search engines and web analytics measures. This would involve setting up a series of "lab-based" user experiments (combinations of virtual, online lab experiments, actual lab environments, and in-situ studies) around specific user tasks and usage scenarios in which users' perceived values are studied for various characteristics through questionnaires and other subjective measures. Data would also be collected through observation and logging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"It is important that experiments are carried out on a sufficiently large and diverse sample of the user population and using a (feasibly) wide range of design variants, user tasks and motivations to ensure generalisability. To reduce bias, appropriate sampling methods with respect to the user population have to be used. Psychological techniques such as experience sampling2 (e.g., [8]) can be used to gain insights on user interactions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"From these experiments, dependency relationships can be established among the di↵erent engagement characteristics, leading to classes of user models for the di↵erent contexts and task types. A specific point of interest is the relationship between incentive structures, rewards, benefits and engagement. The derived user engagement models can then be validated through further experiments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"In order to assess the full range of variables of engagement, it is necessary to test a multitude of scenarios, interaction and graphics designs, for example, di↵erent page layouts, result presentations, modified user interaction models (such as result peek, scratch pad), etc. We anticipate the need for continuous refinement to this methodology, allowing fluid adaptation to the latest findings and the research questions that such results raise." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"Summarising, this line of research will deal with: (1) Classifying characteristics of user engagement as relevant to particular contexts, user tasks, and incentives, and in particular, validating characteristics relevant to web interactions (extending our current work); (2) Identifying whether characteristics can be automatically derived using standard or more advanced web analytic measures or IR metrics and developing prediction models when applicable; (3) Identifying patterns of user engagement (leading to the development of models of user engagement), both from qualitative (surveys, questionnaires, focus groups, participatory design, etc.) and quantitative points of view (through log analysis); (4) Developing from this a methodology for measuring and understanding user engagement, including methods for comparative measures across brands and methods for failure analysis." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})

"New perspectives from immersion in gaming and related areas The goal of the second line of research is to develop novel concepts of user engagement through an examination of the notion of immersion as it is used in gaming." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/6}{Attfield et al 2011:6})
\par
"in a computer game involves being "drawn in", with attention focussed entirely on the game [18]. As such, this phenomenon has much in common with engagement and many ideas emerging from this and related research may be applicable to more general notions of user engagement and notions of user engagement on the web in particular. Some early work on the application of the concept of immersion is Bhatt's [3] preliminary study of interaction with a range of e-commerce web sites. Bhatt finds the relative importance of immersion (compared to interactivity and connectivity) to be genre-dependent; for example, it is far more significant to the fashion industry than it is to the financial industry. This finding concurs with our initial view of the applicability of immersion to user engagement and also the context dependant nature of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"In relation to immersion, of particular interest is the work of Cairns and colleagues. Their early work [6] reported a user study of immersion in gaming. They observed three progressively deeper levels of immersion, which they referred o as engagement, engrossment, and total immersion. In a" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})

"CEGE is a hierarchical model that elaborates a set of necessary conditions of an enjoyable gaming experience. For example, a positive experience depends on the user taking "ownership" of a game, where ownership involves developing high-level strategies and goals and receiving rewards. But this itself is built upon lowerlevel factors such as "control" elements (e.g., interface factors, small actions, point-of-view) and "facilitators" (such as time to play and the user's aesthetic values)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Calvillo-Gamez et al. [7] argue that many of these factors can be meaningfully extrapolated to other kinds of interaction, such as the use of productivity applications." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We propose further exploration of the concept of immersion and concepts from related domains (such as flow, and presence in Virtual Reality experiences) in order to expand and enrich existing notions of engagement. Underpinning this work will be the aim of expanding our understanding of the necessary constituents of an engaging experience. We believe that this can bring valuable new perspectives to the measurement of user engagement on the web. The expected outcomes are: (1) Understanding the links (and contrasts) between user engagement and immersion (and to some extent flow and presence); (2) Leveraging this understanding to enrich our model of user engagement; (3) Developing additional metrics relevant to search and di↵erent genres of web interaction; (4) Conceptual input into largerscale experimentation in tandem with the first line of work (Section 3.1)."

"Designing for user engagement This last line of research explicitly focuses on designing for user engagement, by providing a useful source of validated design ideas. This is based on insights from the other two lines of research to inform the development, validation and refinement of design concepts (initiated in the first line of research - Section 3.1) for services and tools aimed at promoting user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"To conduct such a research, an iterative, user-centred design process incorporating evaluation throughout, should be adopted. Initial qualitative field studies can be used to identify and characterise particular kinds of interaction scenario" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"and their requirements. Scenarios should include individual interaction as well as collaboration, sharing and social interactions. Each scenario would provide a basis for developing conceptual designs, which implement generalisable strategies for promoting engagement appropriate to the context. Prototypes ranging from low to high-fidelity can be developed and evaluated iteratively, with early formative evaluations leading to the development of design improvements. Summative evaluations can then be used to assess design alternatives in terms of user engagement metrics developed in other areas of the work. Overall the process will be aimed at generating and testing generalisable design strategies for promoting engagement in di↵erent contexts, ultimately resulting in reusable recommendations, guidelines and exemplars which can be employed by other designers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"An approach to the cataloguing and communication of design strategies, which we favour, is to record these in the form of interaction design patterns [4]. Patterns are an approach to capturing reusable solutions to recurring design problems within semi-formal representations. As such they o↵er a convenient basis for generating a 'lingua franca' of design solutions that encapsulate a particular set of design values (in this case the promotion of engagement)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"The expected outcomes of this line of research are to: (1) Evaluate prototype solutions for promoting user engagement in a range of contexts; (2) Produce generalisable design recommendations in the form of reusable interaction design patterns."

"CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we advocate the development of an approach for studying, measuring, and explaining user engagement. We first define user engagement, and then report on and classify various characteristics and potential methods for measurement. User engagement is a multifaceted, and complex phenomenon; this applies to both its definition and empirically grounded "signature" characteristics. Both of these give rise to a number of potential approaches for measurement whether objectively or subjectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"We proposed three lines of research that have the potential to shape what we like to refer as the science of user engagement. The first two define methodologies for measurement, whilst the third outlines how these methodologies can lead to user engagement aware front-end technology design." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AQWUM5V2/7}{Attfield et al 2011:7})
\par
"Our proposed approach is motivated by the aim of achieving an innovative yet principled approach to the problems associated with measuring user engagement, building on existing solid and fundamental work and methodology, and taking inspiration from other related areas."

"Website user engagement Engagement been defined as a "state of being involve, occupied, retained and intrinsically interested in something" (Pagani and Mirabello, 2011). In the context of online game, user engagement been defined as the emotional, cognitive and behavioral connection that exist at any point in time and possible over time between user and resources (Attfield, kazai and Lalmas, 2011). They also mentioned a successful technology must have beyond usage and fulfilling the user investment in term of time, attention and emotion. Some researchers relate the definition of user engagement with user experience (Obrien \& Cairns, 2015); (Lehmann, Lalmas \& Dupret, 2012) which includes characteristics such increase attention, positive effect, sensory and intellectual satisfaction and mastery. The total engagement experiencing by users also known as focused immersion measure in cognitive absorption dimension where engagement refer to user's full of attention with intrinsic interest, curiosity and deep focus (Agarwal and Karahanna, 2000)."

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Over the last decade, a rapidly growing open data movement has resulted in government agencies quickly publishing a large volume of data, and the data's subsequent use among a variety of open data consumers. Understanding the activities, actors, technologies and factors enabling open data publication and use has been the subject of discussion among academic researchers and practitioners. However, research is limited, with few empirical studies on open data collecting primary research data from the health domain. To address this gap, we conducted 53 semi?structured key informant interviews with participants in the open health data ecosystem in a variety of roles. Interview data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to identify common themes and develop insights into the objectives, activities and desired outcomes of the open health data ecosystem. We found that data facilitators ? data advocates, typically external to government agencies ? are critical to this process by facilitating open data awareness and successful use. We applied activity theory to examine the facilitator theme and develop a preliminary model of the open health data ecosystem, including the roles, responsibilities and activities of different participants and the role of these facilitators. Our findings suggest that consumers' successful engagement with open health data is fostered by, and perhaps dependent upon, facilitators' activities. These empirically based insights into the structure and workings of the open health data engagement ecosystem can inform jurisdictions' development of open health data engagement strategies thereby improving the success of their open health data initiatives.},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The aim of this research was to explore possible origins of enduring involvement (EI) with products and stimulate relevant research. In addition, this study also examined the conditions that affect involvement development and change. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Autobiographic narratives were gathered from consumers identified as being highly involved with cars, photography, fashion, or jazz. The data were analyzed at the surface structure, the narrative level, and the deep level, to arrive at chronic structures of the episodes discussed in the narratives. Findings \textendash{} EI is a dynamic construct that emerges due to socialization and influences endemic to the product class. Numerous contextual and intervening conditions, such as product tractability, switching costs, disposable variables, and role demands appear to affect the overall development and growth of EI. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} In both the design of a product, as well as the facilitation of product-centered social interaction, marketers can significantly influence the development of a consumer's enduring product involvement. Such a development has long-term implications for consumer spending and behavior in relation to a product category or specific brand. Originality/value \textendash{} The research is among the first works in consumer behavior to map specific elements associated with the development of EI. Further it also helps understand why consumers, rather than become bored, turn increasingly connected and involved with a product category over a period of time. Future research, both qualitative and quantitative, might build upon the results.},

  abstract = {ConclusionTo summarise, this chapter has argued that although words like fun and pleasure are closely related and may each function as a superordinate category for the other, there are experiential and cultural differences between them. Fun has been considered in terms of distraction and pleasure in terms of absorption. This is not to suggest that pleasure is a more worthy pursuit than fun, it is rather an attempt to delineate different but equally important aspects of enjoyment. It is possible to appreciate Shakespeare and still acknowledge that The Simpsons is the greatest achievement of western civilisation. Both offer rich and fulfilling experiences but they are very different kinds of pleasures. As Peter Wright and John McCarthy argue elsewhere in this book, it is not possible to design an experience, only to design for an experience; but in order to do this it is necessary to have an understanding of that experience as it relates to and differs from others.},

  abstract = {This paper examines intrinsic motivation by reviewing various motivational theories and models and discussing whether research supports the hypothesis that teaching strategies can influence intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation, also known as self-motivation, refers to influences that originate from within a person which cause a person to act or learn. This includes self-concept, self-esteem, self-satisfaction, personal values, and personal/emotional needs and drives. The paper focuses on the theories and models of Biddle, Goudas, and Underwood (1995); Hancock (1995); Keller (1979); Bohlin, Milheim, and Viechnicki (1993); and Bandura (1986) and Pajares (1996), noting the various concepts developed to explain their theories and models. Teaching strategies to support the various concepts are suggested as ways to impact intrinsic motivation in the learner. Various components or concepts of intrinsic motivation revealed through the research include autonomy, expectancy, instrumentality, effort, interest, satisfaction, valence, relevance, and self-efficacy. In examining these concepts and the teaching strategies associated with them, it was determined that specific teaching strategies can have a positive effect on the various concepts related to intrinsic motivation. Teachers must be aware of strategies that will positively affect motivation, using an approach that reinforces student willingness and enthusiasm. (Contains 21 references.) (Author/SM},

  abstract = {In today's highly dynamic and interactive business environment, the role of ``customer engagement'' (CE) in cocreating customer experience and value is receiving increasing attention from business practitioners and academics alike. Despite this interest, systematic scholarly inquiry into the concept and its conceptual distinctiveness from other, associated relational concepts has been limited to date. This article explores the theoretical foundations of CE by drawing on relationship marketing theory and the service-dominant (S-D) logic. The analysis also examines the use of the term ``engagement'' in the social science, management, and marketing academic literatures, as well as in specific business practice applications. Five fundamental propositions (FPs) derived from this analysis are used to develop a general definition of CE, and distinguish the concept from other relational concepts, including ``participation'' and ``involvement.'' The five propositions are used in the development of a framework for future research, the undertaking of which would facilitate the subsequent refinement of the conceptual domain of CE. Overall, CE, based on its relational foundations of interactive experience and the cocreation of value, is shown to represent an important concept for research in marketing and service management.},

  abstract = {We - the users turned creators and distributors of content - are TIME's Person of the Year 2006, and AdAge's Advertising Agency of the Year 2007. We form a new Generation C. We have MySpace, YouTube, and OurMedia; we run social software, and drive the development of Web 2.0. But beyond the hype, what's really going on? In this groundbreaking exploration of our developing participatory online culture, Axel Bruns establishes the core principles which drive the rise of collaborative content creation in environments, from open source through blogs and Wikipedia to Second Life. This book shows that what's emerging here is no longer just a new form of content production, but a new process for the continuous creation and extension of knowledge and art by collaborative communities: produsage. The implications of the gradual shift from production to produsage are profound, and will affect the very core of our culture, economy, society, and democracy.},

"his book begins with a simple, yet fundamental proposition: the proposition that to describe the creative, collaborative, and ad hoc engagement with content for which user-led spaces such as the Wikipedia act as examples, the term 'production' is no longer accurate. This, I argue, is true even where we re-imagine the concept of production as 'user-led production,' 'commons-based peer production,' or more prosaicly as the production of 'customer-made' products: not the adjectives and qualifiers which we may attach to the term 'production' are the problem, but the very noun itself" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/1}{Bruns 2008:1})
\par
"Users who participate in the development of open source software, in the collaborative extension and editing of the Wikipedia, in the communal world-building of Second Life, or processes of massively parallelized and decentralized creativity and innovation in myriads of enthusiast communities do no longer produce content, ideas, and knowledge in a way that resembles traditional, industrial modes of production; the outcomes of their work similarly retain only few of the features of conventional products, even though frequently they are able to substitute for the outputs of commercial production processes. User-led content 'production' is instead built on iterative, evolutionary development models in which often very large communities of participants make a number of usually very small, incremental changes to the established knowledge base, thereby enabling a gradual improvement in quality which\textemdash{} under the right conditions\textemdash can nonetheless outpace the speed of product development in the conventional, industrial model. Such modes of content creation\textemdash involving large communities of users, who act without an all-controlling, coordinating hierarchy\textemdash operate along lines which are fluid, flexible, heterarchical, and organized ad hoc as required by the ongoing process of development; they are more closely aligned with the emergent organizational principles in social communities than with the predetermined, supposedly optimized rigid structures of governance in the corporate sphere. User-led content creation in this new model harnesses the collected, collective intelligence of all participants, and manages\textemdash{} though in some cases better than in others\textemdash to direct their contributions to where they are best able to make a positive impact." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/1}{Bruns 2008:1})

Industrial modes of production, from this point of view, provide only one possible paradigm for the development of products, and 'products' themselves are only one possible configuration of information, knowledge, and creative work\textemdash and not necessarily the most appropriate such configuration in the emerging context of the information age." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/2}{Bruns 2008:2})
\par
"Terminology itself, then, is part of the problem: the very term 'product' necessarily implies a specific form of outcome, a process of reaching that outcome, and a set of likely consumer interactions with that outcome." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/2}{Bruns 2008:2})
\par
"The concept of produsage is such a term: it highlights that within the communities which engage in the collaborative creation and extension of information and knowledge that we examine in this book, the role of 'consumer' and even that of 'end user' have long disappeared, and the distinctions between producers and users of content have faded into comparative insignificance. In many of the spaces we encounter here, users are always already necessarily also producers of the shared knowledge base, regardless of whether they are aware of this role\textemdash they have become a new, hybrid, produser." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/2}{Bruns 2008:2})
\par
"Produsage exists within a wider context of new and emerging concepts for describing the social, technological, and economic environment of user-led content creation. In particular, two terms have been used widely (and sometimes all too liberally) to describe the technological and technosocial frameworks for produsage communities: Web 2.0, and social software. Coates provides a useful definition of social software: Social software is a particular sub-class of software-prosthesis that concerns itself with the augmentation of human, social and / or collaborative abilities through structured mediation (this mediation may be distributed or centralised, top-down or bottomup/emergent).1" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/2}{Bruns 2008:2})
\par
"These affordances of social software speak directly to the core principles of produsage as we outline them in the following chapter; indeed, the technological characteristics of social software have emerged in parallel to and under mutual feedback with the social, organizational, and intellectual characteristics of produsage as we will soon encounter them" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/3}{Bruns 2008:3})

"Closely aligned to this understanding of social software as the technology to support and enable sociality and collaboration is the concept of Web 2.0, which highlights specifically the implications of such socially based content creation for the economic world.

"Web 2.0 and similar terms also indicates the significant commercial and industrial attention now paid to the new models of community and content development now emerging from the realm of social software" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/4}{Bruns 2008:4})
\par
"the environments of what we will describe as produsage now often offer credible alternatives to and sustained competition for established industries and their products. For many corporate players who have found it impossible to contain the rise of such alternatives, the question has now shifted from containment to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/4}{Bruns 2008:4})
\par
"In addition to the technological and commercial recognition of produsage as a major driver of change in these contexts, recent years have also seen an increasing popular attention on produsage environments" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/4}{Bruns 2008:4})
\par
"This returns us to wider economic and legal questions which the emergence of produsage as an alternative model to production raises: does the user-led, collaborative, and at least initially often non-profit model of produsage spell the 'casual collapse' of traditional content and copyright industries, as well as of other entities traditionally charged with the accumulation and dissemination of information, knowledge, and creative works (including journalism, educational institutions, and the mass media)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/4}{Bruns 2008:4})
\par
"The concept of produsage is intended as a means of connecting such developments in the cultural, social, commercial, intellectual, economic, and societal realms. The task at hand is to synthesize the various available approaches to examining what happens in commons-based peer production, social software, Web 2.0, and related environments, to move beyond the commonplace assumptions associated with traditional concepts of producers, products, and production, and to develop a systematic understanding of the processes, principles, and participants of produsage" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/5}{Bruns 2008:5})
\par
"e rapid speed of change in online information, knowledge, and creative work which is described by produsage serves to indicate the magnitude of the continuing paradigm shift which we are currently experiencing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KU4UVZMI/6}{Bruns 2008:6})},

In addition, the quality of word frequency measures should be ascertained by correlating them with behavioral word processing data. When we apply these criteria to the word frequency measures available for the German language, we find that the commonly used Celex frequencies are the least powerful to predict lexical decision times. Better results are obtained with the Leipzig frequencies, the dlexDB frequencies, and the Google Books 2000\textendash 2009 frequencies.

Past research on system usage has suffered from a levels bias, with researchers studying system usage at single levels of analysis only (e.g., the individual, group, or organizational level). Although single-level research can be useful, we suggest that studying organizations one level at a time will ultimately lead to an unnatural, incomplete, and very disjointed view of how information systems are used in practice. To redress this situation, we draw on recent advances in multilevel theory to present system usage as a multilevel construct and provide an illustration for what it takes for researchers to study it as such. The multilevel perspective advanced in this article offers rich opportunities for theoretical and empirical insights and suggests a new foundation for in-depth research on the nature of system usage, its emergence and change, and its antecedents and consequences.},

An experiment was conducted to test the research model. The results indicate that rich information leads to a perception of high information overload; and the latter lead consumers to a worse subject state towards decision.

\emph{Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest.

To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns; another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts. We also show how the concept of ``memorable language'' can be extended across domains. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_DC9CEJ4K/1}{note on p.1})}

"Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to information on different topics [28, 36]."

Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, "catchy," or otherwise compelling."

"We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered \textemdash{} highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts."

One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): "Certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone.

\emph{Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest. We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased \textemdash{} the choice of words and sentence structure \textemdash can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns; another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts. We also show how the concept of ``memorable language'' can be extended across domains. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{note on p.1})}

"Beyond all these factors, however, one's everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed \textemdash{} the choice of words, the way it is phrased \textemdash{} might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people's minds.

"We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered \textemdash{} highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts."

\emph{Understanding the ways in which information achieves widespread public awareness is a research question of significant interest. We consider whether, and how, the way in which the information is phrased \textemdash{} the choice of words and sentence structure \textemdash can affect this process. To this end, we develop an analysis framework and build a corpus of movie quotes, annotated with memorability information, in which we are able to control for both the speaker and the setting of the quotes. We find significant differences between memorable and non-memorable quotes in several key dimensions. One is lexical distinctiveness: in aggregate, memorable quotes use less common word choices, but at the same time are built upon a scaffolding of common syntactic patterns; another is that memorable quotes tend to be more general in ways that make them easy to apply in new contexts. We also show how the concept of ``memorable language'' can be extended across domains. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{note on p.1})}

"Understanding what items will be retained in the public consciousness, and why, is a question of fundamental interest in many domains, including marketing, politics, entertainment, and social media; as we all know, many items barely register, whereas others catch on and take hold in many people's minds." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{Cheng et al 2012:1})
\par
\emph{what domains? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{note on p.1})}

"An active line of recent computational work has employed a variety of perspectives on this question" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{Cheng et al 2012:1})
\par
"Building on a foundation in the sociology of diffusion [27, 31], researchers have explored the ways in which network structure affects the way information spreads, with domains of interest including blogs [1, 11], email [37], on-line commerce [22], and social media [2, 28, 33, 38]. There has also been recent research addressing temporal aspects of how different media sources convey information [23, 30, 39] and ways in which people react differently to information on different topics [28, 36]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{Cheng et al 2012:1})
\par
"Beyond all these factors, however, one's everyday experience with these domains suggests that the way in which a piece of information is expressed \textemdash{} the choice of words, the way it is phrased \textemdash{} might also have a fundamental effect on the extent to which it takes hold in people's minds. Concepts that attain wide reach are often carried in messages such as political slogans, marketing phrases, or aphorisms whose language seems intuitively to be memorable, "catchy," or otherwise compelling." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{Cheng et al 2012:1})
\par
"Our first challenge in exploring this hypothesis is to develop a notion of "successful" language that is precise enough to allow for quantitative evaluation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{Cheng et al 2012:1})
\par
"We also face the challenge of devising an evaluation setting that separates the phrasing of a message from the conditions in which it was delivered \textemdash{} highlycited quotes tend to have been delivered under compelling circumstances or fit an existing cultural, political, or social narrative, and potentially what appeals to us about the quote is really just its invocation of these extra-linguistic contexts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/1}{Cheng et al 2012:1})

"distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their nonmemorable counterparts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/2}{Cheng et al 2012:2})
\par
"unusual word choices" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/2}{Cheng et al 2012:2})
\par
"we show a concrete sense in which memorable quotes are indeed distinctive: with respect to lexical language models trained on the newswire portions of the Brown corpus [21], memorable quotes have significantly lower likelihood than their nonmemorable counterparts. Interestingly, this distinctiveness takes place at the level of words, but not at the level of other syntactic features: the part-ofspeech composition of memorable quotes is in fact more likely with respect to newswire. Thus, we can think of memorable quotes as consisting, in an aggregate sense, of unusual word choices built on a scaffolding of common part-of-speech patterns." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/2}{Cheng et al 2012:2})

\par
"With these pairs in hand, we formulate a pairwise comparison task: given M and N , determine which is the memorable quote. Psychological research on subjective evaluation [35], as well as our own initial experiments using the authors as test subjects, indicated that this pairwise set-up is an easier formulation to work with than simply presenting a single sentence and asking whether it is memorable or not; the latter requires agreement on an "absolute" criterion for memorability that is very hard to impose consistently, whereas the former simply requires a judgment that one quote is more memorable than another." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/4}{Cheng et al 2012:4})
\par
"As a preliminary consideration, we did a small pilot study to see if humans can distinguish memorable from non-memorable quotes, assuming our IMDBinduced labels as gold standard" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/4}{Cheng et al 2012:4})
\par
"Thus far we have discussed a dataset in which memorability is determined through an explicit labeling drawn from the IMDb. Given the "production" aspect of memorability discussed in x1, we should also expect that memorable quotes will tend to appear more extensively on Web pages than nonmemorable quotes, and this is something we can estimate from the result counts provided by a search engine." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/5}{Cheng et al 2012:5})
\par
"We now discuss experiments that investigate the hypotheses discussed in x1. In particular, we devise methods that can assess the distinctiveness and generality hypotheses and test whether there exists a notion of "memorable language" that operates across domains. In addition, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these hypotheses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/5}{Cheng et al 2012:5})
\par
"Distinctiveness One of the hypotheses we examine is whether the use of language in memorable quotes is to some extent unusual. In order to quantify the level of distinctiveness of a quote, we take a language-model approach: we model "common language" using the newswire sections of the Brown corpus [21]5 , and evaluate how distinctive a quote is by evaluating its likelihood with respect to this model \textemdash{} the lower the likelihood, the more distinctive. In order to assess different levels of lexical and syntactic distinctiveness, we employ a total of six Laplacesmoothed6 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram part-of-speech7 LMs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/5}{Cheng et al 2012:5})
\par
"memorable quote is more distinctive. Interestingly, the reverse is true when it comes to syntax: memorable quotes appear to follow the syntactic patterns of "common language" as closely as or more closely than non-memorable quotes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/5}{Cheng et al 2012:5})
\par
"gether, these results suggest that memorable quotes consist of unusual word sequences built on common syntactic scaffolding." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/6}{Cheng et al 2012:6})

\par
"ther of our hypotheses is that memorable quotes are easier to use outside the specific context in which they were uttered, and therefore exhibit fewer terms that refer to those settings. As proxies for the generality of a quote, we employ the following syntactic measures:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/6}{Cheng et al 2012:6})
\par
"easier to adapt to new contexts, and so will be considered more general. We exclude second-person pronouns from our analysis to account for the common "generic you" usage." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/6}{Cheng et al 2012:6})
\par
"One of the motivating questions in our analysis is whether there are general principles underlying "memorable language."" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/6}{Cheng et al 2012:6})
\par
"The results thus far suggest potential families of such principles." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/6}{Cheng et al 2012:6})

"With these pairs in hand, we formulate a pairwise comparison task: given M and N , determine which is the memorable quote. Psychological research on subjective evaluation [35], as well as our own initial experiments using the authors as test subjects, indicated that this pairwise set-up is an easier formulation to work with than simply presenting a single sentence and asking whether it is memorable or not; the latter requires agreement on an "absolute" criterion for memorability that is very hard to impose consistently, whereas the former simply requires a judgment that one quote is more memorable than another."

In order to assess different levels of lexical and syntactic distinctiveness, we employ a total of six Laplacesmoothed6 language models: 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram word LMs and 1-gram, 2-gram and 3-gram part-of-speech7 LMs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_SP9C6GJX/5}{Cheng-Kleinberg-Lee 2012:5})

"The present work (i): Evaluating language-based memorability Defining what makes an utterance memorable is subtle, and scholars in several domains have written about this question. There is a rough consensus that an appropriate definition involves elements of both recognition \textemdash{} people should be able to retain the quote and recognize it when they hear it invoked \textemdash{} and production \textemdash{} people should be motivated to refer to it in relevant situations [15]. One suggested reason for why some memes succeed is their ability to provoke emotions [16]. Alternatively, memorable quotes can be good for expressing the feelings, mood, or situation of an individual, a group, or a culture (the zeitgeist): "Certain quotes exquisitely capture the mood or feeling we wish to communicate to someone.

The focus of a special issue of the Journal of Macromarketing (vol. 26, issue 1) underscores this importance. The articles in that special issue lend both conceptual and methodological clarity to the subject of consumer vulnerability, thus bringing to the fore the hitherto overlooked importance of this construct. The purpose of this article is to extend this renewed interest by introducing an integrative view of consumer vulnerability that is a sum of two components: a transient, state-based component dominant in some of the articles in the special issue, and a systemic, class-based component. The proposition is that such an integrative view provides a proactive tool for macromarketers and policy makers in their efforts to safeguard and to empower vulnerable consumers.},

Based on unit-of-analysis and evaluation-type context dimensions, the authors created six IS effectiveness categories. The six effectiveness classes are infusion measures (i.e., "organizational impacts" in the D\&M IS Success Model), market measures (not covered in the D\&M IS Success Model), economic measures (i.e., "organizational impacts"), usage measures (i.e., "system use"), perceptual measures (i.e., "user satisfaction"), and productivity measures (i.e., "individual impact").

Have countries' investments in e-commerce infrastructure yielded a net positive growth in the gross national product?

Cultivating critical thinking skills, such as purposefully reflecting and analyzing one's own thinking, is a major goal of higher education. However, there is a challenge in providing college students opportunities to clearly demonstrate these skills in online courses. This research explores the effectiveness of incorporating word clouds--visual representations of word frequency in a given passage of text--into online discussions. We sought to establish whether implementing word clouds in online discussions would result in a higher incidence of critical thinking and engagement. Survey results from undergraduate participants (n = 132) revealed that students analyzing text in word clouds reported moderately higher scores on critical thinking and engagement than students analyzing the text in a linear fashion. A positive relationship was found between critical thinking and engagement, as well as peer interaction. This strategy can be applied to a wide range of educational environments to stimulate critical thinking and engagement.},

  abstract = {As social media use grows among the general population, becoming a major source of information, government organizations around the world have widely adopted these platforms. While researchers on government social media have acknowledged the potential functions of these technologies for participatory democracy, transparency, and collaboration, we have come to learn that prominent social media sites are also sites for marketing and favorable presentations. Given the diversity of content that may flow through a government social media channel, what kind of content is actually adopted? Moreover, how do users react to these diverse content types? In this empirical study, we collected Facebook posts of local government departments across the United States and categorized each post content using a framework of government social media communication strategies. We then analysed differences in users' reactions in the form of likes, comments, and shares to distinct types of content. We found a number of statistically significant results, providing some evidence for the effects of communication strategy or content type on measures of user interaction. Our results highlight the affective and symbolic nature of social media but also point to higher levels of interaction to instances where governments themselves engage in dialogue with citizens. We believe these results are important for scholars and proponents of government communication as they complicate the notion that social network sites can be a generative source of rational critical thought and deliberative conversations.},

  note = {Content that induces ``high arousal'' \textbf{emotions} (\emph{i.e.}, awe, anxiety, and anger) were found to be particularly effective in making content more engaging and shared in the context of distributing news articles via e-mail (Berger and Milkman, 2012).
\par
Emotional or affective content is not generally acknowledged in studies of government information and communication. However, in the study of Hofmann,~\emph{et al.}~(2013), for example, non-government related information seemed to be the type of content that received the most likes, leading to the suggestion that ``Facebook users are more interested in fun and private issues than in more serious reports on government activities''~[\href{http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/8414/6695\#3}{3}]. This type of content, however, was not theorized, and it was labeled as ``other'' (Hofmann,~\emph{et al.}, 2013). Here, we find it appropriate to make the following hypothesis:
\par
\textbf{\emph{Information provision}}~is understood as the publication of government information and content that fulfils the transparency mandate of government (Bertot,~\emph{et al.}, 2010), a defining characteristic of political democracies (Harrison,~\emph{et al.}, 2012). In the framework adopted here we distinguish between: (1) descriptive information about governmental programs, events, and policy as~\emph{operations and events information}; and, (2) instructions to keep safety and welfare as~\emph{public service announcements}. Operations and events information is information about the government that could be useful or important for citizens to know, fulfilling at least a minimum level of transparency. Public service announcements, however, are instructions or messages that governments give in order to produce broad responses in society in regards to their safety or awareness about social issues (Shoemaker, 1989). These public directives are related to crisis communication where individuals must be quickly instructed on how to respond to dangerous and difficult situations, one reason for which social media has been adopted (Graham,~\emph{et al.}, 2015; Hagen,~\emph{et al.}, 2017).
\par
\textbf{This study analyzed the relationship between user response and the types of social media content created by local government departments in the U.S. for Facebook.}
\par
\textbf{~Research on government social media communication often assumes that if engagement is happening, it is positive and commendable.}
\par
\textbf{However, we can also conceivably propose that reaction behavior is a sign of appreciation for the receipt of informative and therefore valuable content.}
\par
\textbf{However, we did not investigate the quality of conversation on the site. Recent evidence from China (Medaglia and Zhu, 2017) suggests that social network sites (in this case Weibo) are not sites of deliberation as exemplified by the ideal public sphere of Habermas (1989) or any prerogative for informed and reasoned discussion. Indeed, we may explain the greater levels of user interaction to government comments precisely based on the emotional nature of social media responses.~}},

Organisations recognise the social and network value of engagement within social media, and practitioners are endeavouring to build engagement through their social media content. However, theoretically based academic guidance concerning marketing practice and engagement in new media social networks is limited. This article provides a theoretical model to explicate the role of social media content in facilitating engagement behaviour within a social media context. Based on uses and gratifications theory, it provides a model for how an organisation can stimulate positively valenced engagement behaviour through social media and dissuade negatively valenced engagement behaviour in this forum. A typology of social media engagement behaviour is proposed and a series of hypotheses exploring the relationships between social media content and engagement behaviour are presented.},

We apply Baumgartner and Jones's work on agenda setting and punctuated equilibrium, which suggests that policy issues may lie dormant for periods of time until some event triggers attention from the media, interest groups, and elected representatives. In the case study presented, we focus on 21 petitions initiated during the week after the Sandy Hook shooting (14\textendash 21 December 2012) in opposition to gun control or in support of policy proposals that are alternatives to gun control, which we view as mobilized efforts to maintain stability and equilibrium in a policy system threatening to change. Using market basket analysis and social network analysis we found a core group of petitions in the ``support law-abiding gun owners'' theme that were highly connected and four ``communities'' of e-petitioners mobilizing in opposition to change in gun control policies and in favor of alternative proposals.},

Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, \& Freeman, 2015; Snell \& Snell-Siddle, 2013). This research aims to study the effects of socially constructed roles, behaviors and activities in present society in online and mobile environments, in particular, gender as a determinant of consumer behavior and decision making. While ethnicity, class, income, age, and other characteristics are all important considerations when studying consumer behavior, this proposal focuses initially on gender, as it has been shown to be significant to consumers' behavior in the online learning environment (Ashong \& Commander, 2012; Borun, Schaller, Chambers, \& Allison-Bunnell, 2010; Halpern, 2013; Muilenburg \& Berge, 2005; Palmer, Bowman, \& Harroff, 2012). It also continues to be a leading form of segmentation used by researchers, marketers, and advertisers (Halpern, 2013; McSporran \& Young, 2001; Rovai \& Baker, 2005). Since gender is socially constructed-and given the social nature of learning-the study will examine how it is manifested in an online learning environment. The study aims to recognize significant gender gaps in three main areas: user engagement, learner satisfaction, and instructional outcomes.},

  abstract = {The Release of government dataset for public use can potentially strengthen the relationship between the government and its constituents. However, research shows that there are several challenges for open data effectiveness. This paper reviews current determents and issues associated with the open government data (OGD) procedures. The review concentrates on two ends of the spectrum: First, from the perspective of the preparation by the government, focusing on the organization of traditional governmental datasets and how the recording of the data is administered. Second, from the perspective of the users, focusing on the way in which the data is released to the general public and on human-computer interaction (HCI) issues between end-user and data-consumption interfaces. Following a thorough analysis of these two opposing challenges, the paper proposes approaches to mitigate them. This review and subsequent recommendations contribute and expand current understanding of open government data effectiveness and can lead to public policy changes, development of new \&lrm;procedures and strategies, and ultimately improvements at both ends of the federal open data endeavor.},

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose This paper describes an empirical examination of how users' willingness to disclose personal data is influenced by the amount of information provided on landing pages \textendash{} standalone web pages created explicitly for marketing or advertising campaigns. Background Provision of information is a central construct in the IS discipline. Content is a term commonly used to describe the information made available by a website or other electronic medium. A pertinent debate among scholars and practitioners relate to the behavioral impact of content volume: Specifically, does a greater amount of information elicit engagement and compliance, or the other way around? Methodology A series of large-scale web experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) were conducted employing a between-subjects design and A/B testing. Two variants of landing pages, long and short, were created based on relevant behavioral theories. Both variants included an identical form to collect users' information, but different amounts of provided content. User traffic was generated using Google AdWords and randomized between the page using Unbounce.com. Relevant usage metrics, such as response rate (called ``conversion rate''), location, and visit time were recorded. Contribution This research contributes to the body of knowledge on information provision and its effectiveness and carries practical and theoretical implications to practitioners and scholars in Information Systems, Informing Science, Communications, Digital Marketing, and related fields. Findings Analyses of results show that the shorter landing pages had significantly higher conversion rates across all locations and times. Findings demonstrate a negative correlation between the content amount and consumer behavior, suggesting that users who had less information were more inclined to provide their data. Recommendations for Practitioners At a practical level, results can empirically support business practices, design considerations, and content strategy by informing practitioners on the role of content in online commerce. Recommendation for Researchers Findings suggest that the amount of content plays a significant role in online decision making and effective informing. They also contradict prior research on trust, persuasion, and security. This study advances research on the paradoxical relationship between the increased level of information and online decision-making and indicates that contrary to earlier work, not all persuasion theories‎ are ‎effective online. Impact on Society Understanding how information drives behavior has implications in many domains (civic engagement, health, education, and more). This has relevance to system design and public communication in both online and offline contexts. Future Research Using this research as a starting point, future research can examine the impact of content in other contexts, as well as other behavioral drivers (such as demographic data). This can lead to theoretical, methodological, and practical recommendations.},

This paper explores the relationship between content strategy and user experience (UX). Specifically, we examine how the amount of information provided on marketing web pages, often called ``landing pages,'' impact users' willingness to provide their e-mail address (a behavior called ``conversion'' in marketing terms). We describe the results of two large-scale online experiments (n= 535 and n= 27,900) conducted in real-world commercial settings. The observed results indicate a negative correlation between the amount of information on a web page and users' decision-making and engagement.

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel approach to systematically improve interactions with digital content based solely on its wording. Following an interdisciplinary literature review, we recognized three key attributes of words that drive successful interactions: (1) Novelty (2) Familiarity (3) Sentimentality. Based on these attributes, we developed a model to systematically improve a given content using word frequency, sentiment analysis and semantic substitution, and by employing computational linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) tech-niques. We conducted a pilot study (n=416) in which the model was used to formalize evaluation and optimization of academic titles. A between-group design was used to compare responses to the original (control) and modified (treatment) titles. Results show that the modified titles had significantly higher scores for selection, user engage-ment and memorability. Our findings suggest that users' successful interactions with digital content is fostered by, and perhaps dependent upon, the wording being used. They also provide empirical support that engaging content can be systematically evaluated and produced. Implications and future research directions are discussed.},

Our goal is to produce a "comic book" summary, in which a transcript is augmented with keyframes that disambiguate and clarify accompanying text. Unlike most previous keyframe extraction systems which rely primarily on visual cues, we present a linguistically-motivated approach that selects keyframes that contain salient gestures. Rather than learning gesture salience directly, it is estimated by measuring the contribution of gesture to understanding other discourse phenomena. More specifically, we bootstrap from multimodal coreference resolution to identify gestures that improve performance. We then select keyframes that capture these gestures. Our model predicts gesture salience as a hidden variable in a conditional framework, with observable features from both the visual and textual modalities. This approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines that do not use gesture information.},

"The main elements of our approach are literature synopsis, analysis, and discussion (Webster \& Watson, 2002). These three elements serve, in our view, the three main purposes of a literature review, namely, to provide an overview of a discourse domain (e.g., compiling the main terms, elements, constructs, approaches and authors), to analyze and compare the various contributions (as well as their impact), and to highlight current research deficits and future research directions."

"Our review of contributions in the area of information overload is interdisciplinary because it aims to identify similarities and differences among the various management perspectives and show to what extent they have discussed information overload. We hope that by doing so, we can identify synergies between the different streams of information overload research and highlight future research areas. Another benefit of an interdisciplinary literature review is that it can provide a more (cross-)-validated and general collection of possible symptoms, causes, and countermeasures and thus lead to a more complete understanding of the phenomenon. This literature-based understanding can then be used to construct testable models on information overload." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XL6IUUPD/2}{Eppler and Mengis 2004:326})

In this paper, Fricke discusses the knowledge hierarchy, a hierarchical model that represent the linear relationship~ between data\textendash information\textendash knowledge\textendash wisdom (DIKW).
\par
The author analyzes this model through the lens of positivism or operationalism, philosophical theories which I tend to agree with. However, I find the whole discussion relating to Positivsm, Antipositivism and other school of thought to be tedious and not really necessary. I agree that the distinction between data and information is problematic, but I also do not see the confusion between the two concepts as a grave calamity.
\par
\subsubsection{Reflecting On The DIKW Hierarchy‎}

\par
I support the author observation of data as anything that is recorded (basically, a form of unstructured information) and of information as a higher level in the pyramid which involves some value and ``weak knowledge''. As discussed earlier, knowledge is a higher form of information which involves processing and utilizing. Wisdom, at the very top, can be seen as the pinnacle which only a few can reach. ~},

  abstract = {Aim/Purpose  This paper describes an empirical investigation on how consumer behavior is influenced by the volume of content on a commercial landing page-a stand-alone web page designed to collect user data (in this case the user's e-mail address), a behavior called "conversion."  Background  Content is a term commonly used to describe the information made available by a website or other electronic medium. A pertinent debate among scholars and practitioners relate to information volume and consumer behavior: do more details elicit engagement and compliance, operationalized through conversions , or the other way around? Methodology A pilot study (n= 535) was conducted in ‎real-world commercial setting, followed by a series of large-scale online experiments (n= 27,083). Both studies employed a between-group design: Two variations of landing pages, long and short, were created based on various behavioral theories. User traffic to the pages was generated using online advertising and randomized between the pages (A/B testing). Contribution This research contributes to the body of knowledge on the antecedents and outcomes of online commercial interaction, focusing on content as a determinant of consumer decision-making and behavior. Findings The observed results indicate a negative correlation between content volume and users' conversions. The shorter pages had significantly higher conversion rates, across locations and time. Findings suggest that content play a significant role in online decision making. They also contradict prior research on trust, persuasion, and security. Recommendations for Practitioners At a practical level, results can inform practitioners on the importance of content in online commerce. They provide an empirical support to design and content strategy considerations, specifically the use of elaboration in commercial web pages. Recommendation for Researchers At the theoretical level, this research advances the body of knowledge on the paradoxical relationship between the increased level of information and online decision-making and indicates that contrary to earlier work, not all persuasion theories‎ are ‎effective online.

  note = {Aim/Purpose \\
This paper describes an empirical investigation on how consumer behavior is influenced by the volume of content on a commercial landing page-a stand-alone web page designed to collect user data (in this case the user's e-mail address), a behavior called "conversion."
\par
Background \\
Content is a term commonly used to describe the information made available by a website or other electronic medium. A pertinent debate among scholars and practitioners relate to information volume and consumer behavior: do more details elicit engagement and compliance, operationalized through conversions , or the other way around?
\par
Methodology\\
A pilot study (n= 535) was conducted in ‎real-world commercial setting, followed by a series of large-scale online experiments (n= 27,083). Both studies employed a between-group design: Two variations of landing pages, long and short, were created based on various behavioral theories. User traffic to the pages was generated using online advertising and randomized between the pages (A/B testing).
\par
Contribution\\
This research contributes to the body of knowledge on the antecedents and outcomes of online commercial interaction, focusing on content as a determinant of consumer decision-making and behavior.
\par
Findings\\
The observed results indicate a negative correlation between content volume and users' conversions. The shorter pages had significantly higher conversion rates, across locations and time. Findings suggest that content play a significant role in online decision making. They also contradict prior research on trust, persuasion, and security.
\par
Recommendations for Practitioners\\
At a practical level, results can inform practitioners on the importance of content in online commerce. They provide an empirical support to design and content strategy considerations, specifically the use of elaboration in commercial web pages.
\par
Recommendation for Researchers\\
At the theoretical level, this research advances the body of knowledge on the paradoxical relationship between the increased level of information and online decision-making and indicates that contrary to earlier work, not all persuasion theories‎ are ‎effective online.
\par
Impact on Society\\
Understanding how information drive behavior has implications in many domains (civic engagement, health, education and more). This has relevance to system design and public communication in both online and offline contexts, suggesting social value.
\par
Future Research\\
‎Using this research as a starting point, future research can examine the impact of content in other contexts, as well as other behavioral drivers (such as demographic data). This can lead to theoretical, methodological and practical recommendations.},

It begins with anoverview of the transdiscipline, tracing its evolution fromCohen's original proposal to its present state. Next, itconsiders a series of concepts that frequently elude attemptsat rigorous definition. Among these: theory, research,information, knowledge and complexity. With workingdefinitions established, it goes on to explore basic systemstheory, introducing the concept of an informing system. Thekey elements of such systems\textemdash the channel, thesender/informer, and the receiver/client\textemdash are then examinedindividually. The volume concludes with two overviewchapters. The first of these looks at the analysis of a basicinforming system, in which a single informer interacts directlywith a clearly specified client or set of clients. The last chapterextends these ideas to the more complex topologies (e.g.,multiple channels, multiple informers, multiple clients, layersof informing) that are more typical in real world informingcontexts.},

This article compares the effect of transparency on trust in government in the Netherlands and South Korea. The effect is investigated in two similar series of three experiments. The authors hypothesize that the effect of transparency differs because the countries have different cultural values regarding power distance and short- and long-term orientation. Results reveal similar patterns in both countries: transparency has a subdued and sometimes negative effect on trust in government. However, the negative effect in South Korea is much stronger. The difference in the magnitude of transparency's effect suggests that national cultural values play a significant role in how people perceive and appreciate government transparency.},

Fortunately, computational tools can assist policy analysts in uncovering latent patterns from these large textual datasets. This study uses such computational tools to explore e-petitions, viewing them as persuasive texts with linguistic and semantic features that may be related to the popularity of petitions, as indexed by the number of signatures they attract. Using We the People website data, we analyzed linguistic features, such as extremity and repetition, and semantic features, such as named entities and topics, to determine whether and to what extent they are related to petition popularity. The results show that each block of variables independently explains statistically significant variation in signature accumulation, and that 1) language extremity is persistently and negatively associated with petition popularity, 2) petitions with many names tend not to become popular, and 3) petition popularity is associated with petitions that include topics familiar to the public or about important social events. We believe explorations along these lines will yield useful strategies to address the wicked problem of too much text data and to facilitate the enhancement of public participation in policy-making.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade, `user experience' (UX) became a buzzword in the field of human \textendash{} computer interaction (HCI) and interaction design. As technology matured, interactive products became not only more useful and usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire. Driven by the impression that a narrow focus on interactive products as tools does not capture the variety and emerging aspects of technology use, practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on `Empirical studies of the user experience' attempts to give a provisional answer to the question of what is meant by `the user experience'. It provides a cursory sketch of UX and how we think UX research will look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a forecast of the future, but as a proposal \textendash{} a stimulus for further UX research.},

Over the last decade, `user experience' (UX) became a buzzword in the field of human \textendash{} computer interaction (HCI) and interaction design. As technology matured, interactive products became not only more useful and usable, but also fashionable, fascinating things to desire. Driven by the impression that a narrow focus on interactive products as tools does not capture the variety and emerging aspects of technology use, practitioners and researchers alike, seem to readily embrace the notion of UX as a viable alternative to traditional HCI. And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning. The present introduction to the special issue on `Empirical studies of the user experience' attempts to give a provisional answer to the question of what is meant by `the user experience'. It provides a cursory sketch of UX and how we think UX research will look like in the future. It is not so much meant as a forecast of the future, but as a proposal \textendash{} a stimulus for further UX research.

Text expresses a vast, rich range of information, but encodes this information in a form that is difficult to decipher automatically. Perhaps for this reason, there has been little work in text data mining to date, and most people who have talked about it have either conflated it with information access or have not made use of text directly to discover heretofore unknown information. In this paper I will first define data mining, information access, and corpus-based computational linguistics, and then discuss the relationship of these to text data mining. The intent behind these contrasts is to draw attention to exciting new kinds of problems for computational linguists. I describe examples of what I consider to be real text data mining efforts and briefly outline our recent ideas about how to pursue exploratory data analysis over text.},

Health care providers try to develop websites that focus on the users' needs. One of the key factors, to develop users' driven health-related websites, is the focus on users' engagement. This study proposes a research model to investigate what factors are critical to users' engagement in health-related websites. Accordingly, three factors were identified; website usability, website interactivity, and users' perceived quality of health information. Little research has previously explored such a thorough list of factors that affect users' engagement in health-related websites. 240 respondents have participated in an online survey, to test the research model. Results show that the influence of the engagement antecedents, identified by the study, is significant. These factors explain a great percentage of the variance for the engagement. The study is finally concluded by implications for theory and practice.},

This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low prob- abilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.},

"two distinct approaches for answering statistical questions: one that is spontaneous, intuitive, effortless, and fast, and another that is deliberate, rule-governed, effortful, and slow" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=3}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:51})
\par
"From its earliest days, the heuristics and biases program was guided by the idea that intuitive judgments occupy a position -- perhaps corresponding to evolutionary history -- between the automatic parallel operations of perception and the controlled serial operations of reasoning. The boundary between perception and judgment is fuzzy and permeable: the perception of a stranger as menacing is inseparable from a prediction of future harm. Intuitive thinking extends perception-like processing from current sensations to judgment objects that are not currently present, including mental representations that are evoked by language. However, the representations on which intuitive judgments operate retain some features of percepts: they are concrete and specific, and they carry causal propensities and an affective charge." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=3}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:51})
\par
"The ancient idea that cognitive processes can be partitioned into two main families - traditionally called intuition and reason -- is now widely embraced under the general label of dual-process theories" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=4}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:52})
\par
"The subjective assessment of probability resembles the subjective assessment of physical quantities such as distance or size. These judgments are all based on data of limited validity, which are processed according to heuristic rules. For example, the apparent distance of an object is determined in part by its clarity. The more sharply the object is seen, the closer it appears to be. This rule has some validity, because in any given scene the more distant objects are seen less sharply than nearer objects. However, the reliance on this rule leads to systematic errors in the estimation of distance. Specifically, distances are often overestimated when visibility is poor because the contours of objects are blurred. On the other hand, distances are often underestimated when visibility is good because the objects are seen sharply. Thus the reliance on clarity as an indication leads to common biases. Such biases are also found in intuitive judgments of probability" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=5}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:53})
\par
"Early research on the representativeness and availability heuristics was guided by a simple and general hypothesis: when confronted with a difficult question people often answer an easier one instead, usually without being aware of the substitution. A person who is asked "What proportion of long-distance relationships break up within a year?" may answer as if she had been asked "Do instances of swift breakups of long-distance relationships come readily to mind?" This would be an application of the availability heuristic. A professor who has heard a candidate's job talk and now considers the question "How likely is it that this candidate could be tenured in our department?" may answer the much easier question: "How impressive was the talk?". This would be an example of the representativeness heuristic. The heuristics and biases research program has focused primarily on representativeness and availability -- two versatile attributes that are automatically computed and can serve as candidate answers to many different questions. It has also focused on thinking under uncertainty. However, the restriction to particular heuristics and to a specific context is largely arbitrary. We will say that judgment is mediated by a heuristic when an individual assesses a specified target attribute of a judgment object by substituting another property of that object -- the heuristic attribute -- which comes more readily to mind. Many judgments are made by this process of attribute substitution. For an example, consider the well-known study by Strack, Martin, \& Schwarz (1988), in which college students answered a survey that included these two questions: "How happy are you with your life in general?" and "How many dates did you have last month?". The correlation between the two questions was negligible when they occurred in the order shown, but it rose to 0.66 when the dating question was asked first. We suggest that thinking about the dating question automatically evokes an affectively charged evaluation of one's satisfaction in that domain of life, which lingers to become the heuristic attribute when the happiness question is subsequently encountered. The observed value of 0.66 certainly underestimates the true correlation between the target and heuristic attributes, because dating frequency is not a perfect proxy for romantic satisfaction and because of measurement error in all variables. The results suggest that respondents had little besides love on their mind when they evaluated their overall well-being" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=5}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:53})
\par
"compare the population of a familiar foreign city with one that is unfamiliar (Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996), respondents have little recourse but to base their judgments on ease of retrieval or recognition." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=6}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:54})
\par
"The intent to judge a target attribute initiates a search for a reasonable value. Sometimes this search terminates almost immediately because the required value can be read from a stored memory (e.g., the question "How tall are you?") or current experience ("How much do you like this cake?"). For other judgments, however, the target attribute does not come to mind immediately, but the search for it evokes other attributes that are conceptually and associatively related (e.g., a question about overall happiness may retrieve the answer to a related question about satisfaction with a particular domain of life). Attribute substitution occurs when the target attribute is assessed by mapping the value of another attribute on the target scale. This process will control judgment when three conditions are satisfied: (1) the target attribute is relatively inaccessible; (2) a semantically and associatively related candidate attribute is highly accessible; and (3) the substitution of the heuristic attribute in the judgment is not rejected by the critical operations of System 2." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=6}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:54})
\par
"cognitive fluency in perception and memory (e.g., Jacoby and Dallas, 1991; Schwarz and Vaughn, Chapter 5 this volume; Tversky and Kahneman, 1973)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=6}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:54})
\par
"surprisingness (Kahneman and Miller, 1986)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=6}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:54})
\par
"affective valence (e.g., Bargh, 1997; Cacioppo, Priester, and Berntson, 1993; Kahneman, Ritov and Schkade, 1999; Slovic et al., this volume; Zajonc, 1980)," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=6}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:54})
\par
"It has become evident that an affect heuristic (Slovic et al., Chapter 23 this volume) should replace anchoring in the list of major general-purpose heuristics." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=7}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:55})
\par
"There is now compelling evidence for the proposition that every stimulus evokes an affective evaluation, and that this evaluation can occur outside of awareness" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=7}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:55})
\par
"intuitive and unintentional process of attribute substitution, which we attribute to System 1. However, attribute substitution can also be a deliberate System 2 strategy, as when a voter decides to evaluate candidates solely by their stance on a particular issue. In other cases, a heuristic is both initiated spontaneously by System 1 and deliberately adopted by System 2. The recognition heuristic proposed by Gigerenzer and his colleagues appears to fall in that class. Experiments described by Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996; see also Gigerenzer et al, 1999) show that respondents rely on feelings of familiarity and unfamiliarity to compare uncertain quantities, such as the relative size of two cities." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=9}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:57})
\par
"Hypotheses about judgment heuristics have most often been studied by examining weighting biases and deviations from normative rules. However, the hypothesis that one attribute is substituted for another in a judgment task - for example, representativeness for probability -- can also be tested more directly. In the heuristic elicitation design, one group of respondents provides judgments of a target attribute for a set of objects and another group evaluates the hypothesized heuristic attribute for the same objects." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=9}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:57})
\par
"In the heuristic elicitation design, one group of respondents provides judgments of a target attribute for a set of objects and another group evaluates the hypothesized heuristic attribute for the same objects. The substitution hypothesis implies that the judgments of the two groups, when expressed in comparable units (e.g., percentiles), will be identical. This section examines several applications of heuristic elicitation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HAVUCCPF?page=9}{Kahneman and Frederick 2002:57})

These conspicuous regions are often referred to as salient, and the extent to which they guide human fixations has been a widely studied topic (Borji \& Itti, 2013; Tatler, Hayhoe, Land, \& Ballard, 2011)."

  abstract = {Judgments about memory are essential in promoting knowledge; they help identify trustworthy memories and predict what information will be retained in the future. In the three experiments reported here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying predictions about memory. In Experiments 1 and 2, single words were presented once or multiple times, in large or small type. There was a double dissociation between actual memory and predicted memory: Type size affected predicted but not actual memory, and future study opportunities affected actual memory but scarcely affected predicted memory. The results of Experiment 3 suggest that beliefs and judgments are largely independent, and neither consistently resembles actual memory. Participants' underestimation of future learning\textemdash a stability bias\textemdash stemmed from an overreliance on their current memory state in making predictions about future memory states. The overreliance on type size highlights the fundamental importance of the ease-of-processing heuristic: Information that is easy to process is judged to have been learned well.},

We test constructs from information systems (Technology Acceptance Model), marketing (Consumer Behavior), and psychology (Flow and Environmental Psychology) in an integrated theoretical framework of online consumer behavior. Specifically, we examine how emotional and cognitive responses to visiting a Web-based store for the first time can influence online consumers' intention to return and their likelihood to make unplanned purchases. The instrumentation shows reasonably good measurement properties and the constructs are validated as a nomological network. A questionnaire-based empirical study is used to test this nomological network. Results confirm the double identity of the online consumer as a shopper and a computer user because both shopping enjoyment and perceived usefulness of the site strongly predict intention to return. Our results on unplanned purchases are not conclusive. We also test some individual and Web site factors that can affect the consumer's emotional and cognitive responses. Product involvement, Web skills, challenges, and use of value-added search mechanisms all have a significant impact on the Web consumer. The study provides a more rounded, albeit partial, view of the online consumer and is a significant steptowards a better understanding of consumer behavior on the Web. The validated metrics should be of use to researchers and practitioners alike.},

"2.2.2. Perceived Control. Perceived control has been used in several theoretical frameworks under different variations such as perceived locus of control (Rotter 1966), perceived control in achievement motivation theory (Atkinson 1964), self-efficacy (Bandura 1982), and perceived behavioral control in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) (Ajzen 1991). In flow research, perceived control has been defined as the level of one's control over the environment and one's actions. It is similar to Bandura's self-efficacy and Ajzen's perceived behavioral control in that it is specific to an action and it can vary for different situations or actions. In the same way, self-efficacy can be taskor situationspecific and perceived behavioral control in TPB is directed towards a specific behavior. Perceived control is also similar to the emotional response of dominance from environmental psychology, where it is defined as feeling "unrestricted or free to act in a variety of ways" in a specific situation and environment (Mehrabian and Russel 1974)."

"Concentration/Attention Focus. For an individual to be in "flow," they must concentrate on their activity. Therefore, concentration has been a significant correlate or measure of flow. It can also play a role in online consumer behavior. Web customers can have a short attention span because of their limited resources of time and information processing (Engel et al. 1990, Quelch and Klein 1996, Miller 1956) together with increased levels of control (Hoffman and Novak 1997, Sheth and Sisodia 1997). However, concentration can be critical for completing their purchases efficiently. Buying online is carried out in front of a computer at home, with numerous distractions (such as children, television, and the telephone) or at the office (where distractions include work, colleagues, and phone calls.) A consumer can also be distracted by other online activities like e-mail, instant messaging, or other Web sites. Such distractions can limit online consumer concentration. When consumers shop in the physical world, they must allocate most of their attention to that task. They must walk or drive to the stores, look through the products, interact with sales people, and make purchases. They are not able to perform any other activities such as pay their bills or answer their e-mails" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UUFV2G29/6}{Koufaris 2002:210})

  abstract = {Prior work on user engagement with online media identified web page dwell time as a key metric reflecting level of user engagement with online news articles. While on average, dwell time gives a reasonable estimate of user experience with a news article, it is not able to capture important aspects of user interaction with the page, such as how much time a user spends reading the article vs. viewing the comment posted by other users, or the actual proportion of article read by the user. In this paper, we propose a set of user engagement classes along with new user engagement metrics that, unlike dwell time, more accurately reflect user experience with the content. Our user engagement classes provide clear and interpretable taxonomy of user engagement with online news, and are defined based on amount of time user spends on the page, proportion of the article user actually reads and the amount of interaction users performs with the comments. Moreover, we demonstrate that our metrics are relatively easier to predict from the news article content, compared to the dwell time, making optimization of user engagement more attainable goal.},

"We take one step further and develop a probabilistic model that accounts for both the extent of the engagement and the textual topic of the article" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/2}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:114})
\par
"We put forward four user engagement levels that characterize how users attend to articles they have decided to read, as they landed on the article page. We recall that we are not attempting to capture scrolling behaviors, but to exploit these to understand which parts of a news article users engaged with, and to map these to the four proposed engagement levels. Our analysis shows that these levels are intuitive, and bring more rened insights about how user engage with articles, than using dwell time alone. The engagement levels were derived using the viewport time information, which can be computed through scalable and non-intrusive instrumentation. Next, we study how viewport time can be used to predict these levels of engagement based on the textual topics of a news article." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/7}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:119})
\par
"The four user engagement level metrics derived in the previous section provide clear criteria for measuring user engagement in the context of news reading at sub-document level, thus accounting for user attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/7}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:119})
\par
"n this section we investigate whether we can model the distribution of user engagement levels with an article purely from the article textual content. If we are able to do this, this would allow us (and news content providers) to optimize online news content more eectively, compared to current methods." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/7}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:119})
\par
"Such approach allows us to learn a joint mapping between text content and user engagement, which can be used to either predict future level of user engagement or to better understand which topics attract user interest and lead to higher level of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/8}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:120})
\par
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst attempt to combine these types of data into a joint model. While the model extension presented in this paper is a relatively simple one, it provides a clean way to combined both sources of information. We nonetheless plan to investigate more sophisticated ways to combine textual and viewport data in future work." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/8}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:120})

"This paper proposes a novel way to measure user engagement in the context of online news reading. We focus on viewport time, which is the time a user spends viewing an article at a given position and which can be instrumented at large scale, to derive measurement of engagement that accounts for how users attend to the content they are reading. We analyzed the viewport data of a sample of 267,210 page views on a total of 1,971 news articles from a ma jor online news website from Yahoo." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/9}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:121})

"Second, we carry out an analysis of viewport data, employing a mixture of Markov chains, to identify how users read articles, and accounting for the depth of the article consumption." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/9}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:121})
\par
"We found that the reading depth diers greatly ranging from deep engagement, when the entire article is read, to relatively short reading, when users leave after examining the rst screen of the article. These patterns inspired us to propose a taxonomy for user engagement, with four levels, namely Bounce, Shal low engagement, Deep engagement and Complete engagement. Our analysis shows that these levels are intuitive, and bring more rened insights about how user engage with articles, than using dwell time alone."

"We take one step further and develop a probabilistic model that accounts for both the extent of the engagement and the textual topic of the article" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/2}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:114})
\par
"We put forward four user engagement levels that characterize how users attend to articles they have decided to read, as they landed on the article page. We recall that we are not attempting to capture scrolling behaviors, but to exploit these to understand which parts of a news article users engaged with, and to map these to the four proposed engagement levels. Our analysis shows that these levels are intuitive, and bring more rened insights about how user engage with articles, than using dwell time alone. The engagement levels were derived using the viewport time information, which can be computed through scalable and non-intrusive instrumentation. Next, we study how viewport time can be used to predict these levels of engagement based on the textual topics of a news article." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/7}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:119})

"The four user engagement level metrics derived in the previous section provide clear criteria for measuring user engagement in the context of news reading at sub-document level, thus accounting for user attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/7}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:119})
\par
"n this section we investigate whether we can model the distribution of user engagement levels with an article purely from the article textual content. If we are able to do this, this would allow us (and news content providers) to optimize online news content more eectively, compared to current methods." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/7}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:119})
\par
"Such approach allows us to learn a joint mapping between text content and user engagement, which can be used to either predict future level of user engagement or to better understand which topics attract user interest and lead to higher level of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/8}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:120})
\par
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst attempt to combine these types of data into a joint model. While the model extension presented in this paper is a relatively simple one, it provides a clean way to combined both sources of information. We nonetheless plan to investigate more sophisticated ways to combine textual and viewport data in future work." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/8}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:120})

\par
"This paper proposes a novel way to measure user engagement in the context of online news reading. We focus on viewport time, which is the time a user spends viewing an article at a given position and which can be instrumented at large scale, to derive measurement of engagement that accounts for how users attend to the content they are reading. We analyzed the viewport data of a sample of 267,210 page views on a total of 1,971 news articles from a ma jor online news website from Yahoo." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/9}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:121})
\par
"Second, we carry out an analysis of viewport data, employing a mixture of Markov chains, to identify how users read articles, and accounting for the depth of the article consumption." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_66EVIQFR/9}{Lagun and Lalmas 2016:121})
\par
"We found that the reading depth diers greatly ranging from deep engagement, when the entire article is read, to relatively short reading, when users leave after examining the rst screen of the article. These patterns inspired us to propose a taxonomy for user engagement, with four levels, namely Bounce, Shal low engagement, Deep engagement and Complete engagement. Our analysis shows that these levels are intuitive, and bring more rened insights about how user engage with articles, than using dwell time alone."

User engagement is a key concept in the design of online applications (whether for desktop, tablet or mobile), motivated by the observation that successful applications are not just used, but are engaged with. Users invest time, attention, and emotion in their use of technology, and seek to satisfy pragmatic and hedonic needs. Measurement is critical for evaluating whether online applications are able to successfully engage users, and may inform the design of and use of applications. User engagement is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon; this gives rise to a number of potential measurement approaches. Common ways to evaluate user engagement include using self-report measures, e.g., questionnaires; observational methods, e.g. facial expression analysis, speech analysis; neuro-physiological signal processing methods, e.g., respiratory and cardiovascular accelerations and decelerations, muscle spasms; and web analytics, e.g., number of site visits, click depth. These methods represent various trade-offs in terms of the setting (laboratory versus ``in the wild''), object of measurement (user behaviour, affect or cognition) and scale of data collected. For instance, small-scale user studies are deep and rich, but limited in terms of generalizability, whereas large-scale web analytic studies are powerful but negate users' motivation and context. The focus of this book is how user engagement is currently being measured and various considerations for its measurement. Our goal is to leave readers with an appreciation of the various ways in which to measure user engagement, and their associated strengths and weaknesses. We emphasize the multifaceted nature of user engagement and the unique contextual constraints that come to bear upon attempts to measure engagement in different settings, and across different user groups and web domains.

  abstract = {E-commerce success, especially in the business-to-consumer area, is determined in part by whether consumers trust sellers and products they cannot see or touch, and electronic systems with which they have no previous experience. This paper describes a theoretical model for investigating the four main antecedent influences on consumer trust in Internet shopping, a major form of business-to-consumer e-commerce: trustworthiness of the Internet merchant, trustworthiness of the Internet as a shopping medium, infrastructural (contextual) factors (e.g., security, third-party certification), and other factors (e.g., company size, demographic variables). The antecedent variables are moderated by the individual consumer's degree of trust propensity, which reflects personality traits, culture, and experience. Based on the research model, a comprehensive set of hypotheses is formulated and a methodology for testing them is outlined. Some of the hypotheses are tested empirically to demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical model. The findings indicate that merchant integrity is a major positive determinant of consumer trust in Internet shopping, and that its effect is moderated by the individual consumer's trust propensity.},

In three studies, we examined order preferences of news-givers and news-recipients and the consequences of these preferences. Study 1 confirmed that news-givers and news-recipients differ in their news order preferences. Study 2 tested two solutions to close the preference gap between news-givers and recipients and found that both perspective-taking and priming emotion-protection goals shift news-givers' delivery patterns to the preferred order of news-recipients. Study 3 provided evidence that news order has consequences for recipients, such that opening with bad news (as recipients prefer) reduces worry, but this emotional benefit undermines motivation to change behavior.},

In the first study, participants twice rated the visual appeal of web homepages presented for 500 ms each. The second study replicated the first, but participants also rated each web page on seven specific design dimensions. Visual appeal was found to be closely related to most of these. Study 3 again replicated the 500 ms condition as well as adding a 50 ms condition using the same stimuli to determine whether the first impression may be interpreted as a 'mere exposure effect' (Zajonc 1980). Throughout, visual appeal ratings were highly correlated from one phase to the next as were the correlations between the 50 ms and 500 ms conditions. Thus, visual appeal can be assessed within 50 ms, suggesting that web designers have about 50 ms to make a good first impression.},

Current engagement measures rely mostly on data collected by observers or self-reported by the participants. In this paper, we describe a learning analytic system called Tracer, which derives behavioral engagement measures and creates visualizations of behavioral patterns of students writing on a cloud-based application. The tool records the intermediate stages of document development and uses this data to measure learners' behavioral engagement and derive three visualizations. Writers (N= 23 University students) participated in a controlled one-hour writing session in which they post-facto self-reported their level of behavioral engagement. Results show that the level of behavioral engagement automatically estimated by the system correlates with the level reported by the participants. Additionally, users stated that the visualizations were coherent with their writing activity and were useful to help them reflect on the writing process.},

Automatic titling is an essential task for several applications: 'No Subject' e-mails titling, text generation, summarization, and so forth. This study presents an original approach consisting in titling journalistic articles by nominalizing. In particular, morphological and semantic processing are employed to obtain a nominalized form which has to respect titles characteristics (in particular, relevance and catchiness). The evaluation of the approach, described in the paper, indicates that titles stemming from this method are informative and/or catchy.},

The research identifies 39 distinct experiences involved in reading magazines. We propose that these experiences are a way of describing the media context for ads that appear in magazines. We show that the large majority of these experiences are related to advertising effectiveness. The more readers experience a magazine as ``making them smarter,'' for instance, the more effective an ad in the magazine is. A context-free control group is included in the analysis. Heterogeneity across magazines is also examined, and it is further shown that these effects hold over the 100 largest magazines in the United States.},

Digital government policies in the West tend to turn their attention to user-centered design principles. In the United Kingdom, the Government Digital Service (GDS) proclaims, ``users \dots{} are at the centre of everything we do,''\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.6.2016.0436\#r022}{\textsuperscript{22}}~while in the United States, a ```customer centric' approach influences the creation, management and presentation of government information.''\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.6.2016.0436\#r023}{\textsuperscript{23}}~The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says state services should look to ``re-organise themselves around user expectations, needs and associated requirements, rather than their own internal logic and needs.''\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.6.2016.0436\#r024}{\textsuperscript{24}}~These are different policy responses not least in their political orientation to citizenship, but they share a determination to configure their services for everybody\textemdash citizens, publics, and customers (internal and external to government)\textemdash via commitments to accessibility of information platforms and openness of processes.
\par
Participatory design processes are also integral to varying degrees. The OECD's Public Governance Committee, for example, declares that digital government services will give rise to greater ``public engagement,'' as well as citizen/state co-creation:
\par
This new digital environment offers opportunities for more collaborative and participatory relationships that allow relevant stakeholders \dots{} to actively shape political priorities, collaborate in the design of public services and participate in their delivery to provide more coherent and integrated solutions to complex challenges.\href{http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.6.2016.0436\#r025}{\textsuperscript{25}}
\par
Such intentions are laudable, and suggest policy makers are starting to attend to the politics of interdependence and cooperative problem solving in heterogenous societies. Yet the OECD recommendations do not directly address gender equity, let alone cultural difference. Indeed, none of the digital government policies we have quoted here so far mentions gender as a factor of particular significance or sustainable and credible interest. We also see the limits of gender awareness in the EU's benchmarking of online public service delivery across nations
\par
----
\par
In Europe, the United States, Canada, India, Brazil, South Korea, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere, digital government policies have promised efficient, equitable, and empowering outcomes for all. Although these initiatives exhibit local variations, broadly speaking they are grounded in generic assumptions about the co-productive capacities, identity, and agency of citizens as so-called ``end users'' of evolving communications systems.},

``Presentation of self: The crafting of a personal profile or virtual self over time signifies identity. The combination of various elements and their respective updates yields a virtual self: a user's name, lists of interests, profile picture, content the user chooses to share, and the manner in which users engage with others through social media. 2. Action and participation: Social media sites allow users to perform a variety of tasks such as viewing shared content, posting content, commenting, discussing, and collaborating. 3. Uses and gratifications: Users are motivated to adopt and continue using social media for a variety of reasons, ranging from the information to be exchanged to the social benefits to be derived.''

We conducted a systematic review of 87 quantitative studies, analyzing different operationalizations and measures of game enjoyment, its determinants, and how these were related to other components of PX, such as flow, presence and immersion. Results suggest that game enjoyment describes the positive cognitive and affective appraisal of the game experience, and may in part be associated with the support of player needs and values. Further, we outline that enjoyment is distinct from flow in that it may occur independently of challenge and cognitive involvement, and argue that enjoyment may be understood as the valence of the player experience. We conclude with a discussion of methodological challenges and point out opportunities for future research on game enjoyment.},

\par
"These themes of importance and complexity remain emphasized today (Bayerl et al. 2016; Schmitz et al. 2016). Another stable theme has been that IS use is ultimately a behavior or an activity (Compeau et al. 1999; Srinivasan 1985). While later papers added to this view (as noted below), the behavioral actions or the 'doings' of use are still considered of central importance (Ortiz de Guinea and Webster 2014, Gaskin et al. 2014)."

"The main revolutionary change involved the development of a robust theory of IT acceptance," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XGN89M48/2}{Abhay Mishra et al 2017:2})
\par
"Whereas IT acceptance research often conceptualized IS use as a dependent variable only, research on post-adoptive use often examines IS use as part of an ongoing process with the aim of understanding how it is shaped by and in turn shapes a variety of other phenomena at multiple levels of analysis (Jasperson et al. 2005, Burton-Jones and Gallivan 2007, Nan 2011, Gaskin et al. 2014" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XGN89M48/2}{Abhay Mishra et al 2017:2})
\par
"The main evolutionary change has involved the gradual increase in sophistication with which researchers define, theorize, and empirically account for the nature of IS use. For many years, researchers treated IS use quite simply (Straub and del Guidice 2012), defining it as a behavior alone (Compeau et al. 1999; Srinivasan 1985). This view gradually gave way to a richer view encompassing users' cognition, emotion, and behavior in use (Burton-Jones and Gallivan 2007) and researchers began to consider each of its elements more closely (e.g., users, features, tasks, and time). As Subramani (2004) noted, the behavioral view alone was simply too descriptive and incomplete" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XGN89M48/3}{Abhay Mishra et al 2017:3})
\par
"The first major thematic advance involved the application, refinement, and integration of various social psychological explanations of IT acceptance (Bandura 1977; Fishbein and Ajzen 1975; Triandis 1971). This was a particularly strong theme in the 1990s and early 2000s, spurred on from Davis (1989), and many of the most-cited papers in IS fall into this category. Venkatesh et al. (2003) provides the seminal treatment of this line of work. The second major thematic advance has involved the development of theories to account for the dynamics of use, whether at a single level of analysis (e.g., at the individual, group, or organizational level) or across multiple levels. By dynamics, we mean that IS use is ill-suited to being studied in binary terms (i.e., as just present or absent). Rather, it is an activity that occupies multiple dimensions in space/time and the key is figuring out how best to capture that activity in a given study. Because of the complexity of these dynamics, researchers have not sought one unifying theory, but instead have used different theories to account for distinctive characteristics of these dynamics in a given context. For instance, some researchers have focused on characteristics of systems in use, such as emergence (the fact that benefits from use take time to emerge) and interdependence (the fact that use of a given system may be impacted by or relate to other internal or external systems). Such ideas have been tackled using theories of adaptation and affordances at the individual and group levels (Leonardi 2013; Majchrzak et al. 2000; Nevo et al. 2016; Schmitz et al. 2016), theories of sociomateriality at the community and practice levels (Gaskin et al. 2014; Venters et al. 2014), and theories of capabilities at the organizational and plant levels (Banker et al. 2006; Gattiker and Goodhue 2005; Rai et al. 2012; Ray et al. 2005; Subramani 2004)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XGN89M48/3}{Abhay Mishra et al 2017:3})
\par
"The third major thematic advance has been the development of richer measurement and methodological approaches that allow researchers to capture the complexity of the usage process more accurately and provide a clearer explanation of how IS use relates to a host of other phenomena. This" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XGN89M48/4}{Abhay Mishra et al 2017:4})

Other articles have improved our understanding of how IS use is embedded in processes in practice (Davidson and Chismar 2007; Levina and Vaast 2005; Serrano and Karahanna 2016; Venters et al. 2014)."

  abstract = {This article assesses the main findings and dominant modes of inquiry in recent                 scholarship on online news consumption. The findings suggest that the consumption of                 news on the internet has not yet differed drastically from the consumption of news                 in traditional media. The assessment shows that the dominant modes of inquiry have                 also been characterized by stability rather than change (because research has                 usually drawn on traditional theoretical and methodological approaches). In                 addition, these modes of inquiry exhibit three systematic limitations: the                 assumption of a division between print, broadcast, and online media; the notion that                 the analysis should treat media features and social practices separately; and the                 inclination to focus on ordinary or extraordinary patterns of phenomena but not on                 both at the same time. On the basis of this assessment, this article proposes an                 integrative research agenda that builds on this scholarship but also contributes to                 solve some of its main limitations.},

The impact of the Internet and other technological advances are constantly referred to at most junctures of today's Communication research agendas. The area of Political Communication is not immune to this trend. The effects of the Internet and digital media on today's political landscape, with a particular emphasis on enhancing individuals' civic duties and engagement levels, are theme of concern at many of the most renowned journals in Communication and Political Science disciplines.   First, this book pays attention to the overall impact of the Internet and people's use of digital media and new technologies to analyze civic life at large, reconceptualizing what citizenship is today. Secondly, and more specifically, participants shed light over the intersection of a number of current new agendas of research in regards to some of the most rapidly growing technological advances (i.e., new publics and citizenship), and the emergence of sprouting structures of citizenship. The volume shows the implications that new technological advances carry with respect the possibilities, patterns and mechanisms for citizen communication, citizen deliberation, public sphere and civic engagement.},

\textbf{cost\textendash benefit analysis}~on the part of users:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Cost: how much hassle and pain do I have to suffer on this website?
\item Benefits: What's in it for me, what will I gain if I read this information?

\end{itemize}

\par
guidelines
\par
The main guidelines to ensure legibility are:
\par
Readability
\par
legibility\\
Definition:~Readability~measures the complexity of the words and sentence structure in a piece of content. The assumption behind this metric is that complex sentences are harder to parse and read than simpler ones. It's usually reported as the~reading level~(stated as years of formal education) needed to easily read the text. For example, a 12th~grade reading level means that somebody with a good high-school diploma will be able to read the text without difficulty.\\
The main guidelines to ensure readability are:
\par
Use~plainspoken words, the shorter the better. Avoid fancy words and~made-up terms.\\
Use short sentences. Avoid convoluted sentence structures, especially compound sentences with many subordinate clauses and conjunctions that put a strain on users'~short-term memory, which is a notorioriously weak point. (That last sentence is already pushing it a little :-)\\
Mainly write in the active voice. (Passive voice~can be used in rare circumstances when it allows frontloading of key terms.)\\
Aim at an~8th-grade reading level~if targeting a broad consumer audience.\\
If writing for an educated or specialized B2B audience, still target a reading level several steps below the audience's formal-education level. A~12th-grade reading level~is often a good target to make text easy for readers with college degrees. (The article you're reading right now has an 11th-grade reading level, and I hope you find it readable.)\\
Remember that writing at an Nth-grade reading level is a different matter than writing for students who're currently attending school in that grade. There are special design guidelines for targeting~young kids,~teenagers, and~millennials, and that's not what we want on a mainstream website for grownup users. We simply want words and sentences that correspond to that level of educational achievement, but written in a mature tone of voice.
\par
\subsection{Comprehension}

\begin{quotation}
Definition:~\textbf{Comprehension}~measures whether a user can understand the intended meaning of a text and can draw the correct conclusions from the text. In the case of instructional or action-oriented content, we also want users to be able to perform the intended actions after reading the text.

\end{quotation}

\par
The main comprehension guidelines are:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item Use~\href{http://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-centric-language/}{user-centric language}; terms familiar to your audience facilitate comprehension.
\item If targeting a specialized audience (e.g., for a B2B, scientific, or enthusiast/fan/hobbyist site),~\href{http://www.nngroup.com/articles/specialized-words-specialized-audience/}{use the specialized terminology of that field}, even if some of these words are difficult for a broad consumer audience, and thus lower your readability score.
\item Use an~\textbf{inverted-pyramid writing style:~}start with the conclusion or an overview of the main point. People relate better to subsidiary points when they already know the basics.
\item \href{http://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/}{Minimize cognitive load}~by building on existing mental models and reducing the need for users to remember things from one part of text to another.
\item \textbf{Pictures}~or conceptual diagrams can sometimes explain things better than reams of words.
\item Be brief. If you say less, people are more likely to make the effort to understand what you do say.
\item If mobile users are important to you,~\href{http://www.nngroup.com/articles/defer-secondary-content-for-mobile/}{be even briefer and simplify even more}. The~\href{http://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-content-is-twice-as-difficult/}{smaller viewport hurts comprehension}~because users can see little context at a glance and can't easily refer back to previously read information.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Content Usability: Beyond Legibility, Readability, and Comprehension}

\par
Just because people can read and understand your content doesn't mean that they will do so. On the average web-page visit, users read only 28\% of the words.
\par
Still, users sometimes do read web content, particularly when it includes information of interest to them. The key point is to grab users quickly, and get them interested before they decide to leave, which they often do right away.},

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

"The solution is human-centered design (HCD), an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behavior first, then designs to accommodate those needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving. Good design starts with an understanding of psychology and technology. Good design requires good communication, especially from machine to person, indicating what actions are possible, what is happening, and what is about to happen. Communication is especially important when things go wrong." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/27}{Norman 2013:27})

": affordances, signifiers, constraints, mappings, and feedback. But there is a sixth principle, perhaps most important of all: the conceptual model of the system. It is the conceptual model that provides true understanding" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/29}{Norman 2013:29})
\par
"The term affordance refers to the relationship between a physical object and a person (or for that matter, any interacting agent, whether animal or human, or even machines and robots). An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/30}{Norman 2013:30})
\par
"Glass affords transparency." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/30}{Norman 2013:30})
\par
"s. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call this property a signifier (discussed in the next section). The notion of affordance and the insights it provides originated with J. J. Gibson, an eminent psychologist who provided many advances to our understanding of human perception." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/31}{Norman 2013:31})
\par
""Information pickup" was one of his favorite phrases, and Gibson believed that the combined information picked up by all of our sensory apparatus\textemdash sight, sound, smell, touch, balance, kinesthetic, acceleration, body position\textemdash{} determines our perceptions without the need for internal processing or cognition" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/31}{Norman 2013:31})
\par
". I call the signaling component of affordances signifiers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/32}{Norman 2013:32})
\par
"SIGNIFIERS" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/32}{Norman 2013:32})
\par
"Affordances determine what actions are possible. Signifiers communicate where the action should take place. We need both." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/33}{Norman 2013:33})
\par
"The signifier is an important communication device to the recipient, whether or not communication was intended. It doesn't matter whether the useful signal was deliberately placed or whether it is incidental: there is no necessary distinction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/34}{Norman 2013:34})
\par
"Affordances are the possible interactions between people and the environment. Some affordances are perceivable, others are not. {$\bullet$} Perceived affordances often act as signifiers, but they can be ambiguous. {$\bullet$} Signifiers signal things, in particular what actions are possible and how they should be done. Signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/38}{Norman 2013:38})
\par
"In design, signifiers are more important than affordances, for they communicate how to use the design. A signifier can be words, a graphical illustration, or just a device whose perceived affordances are unambiguous. Creative designers incorporate the signifying part of the design into a cohesive experience. For the most part, designers can focus upon signifiers. Because affordances and signifiers are fundamentally important principles of good design" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/38}{Norman 2013:38})
\par
"Profound ideas are always obvious once they are understood." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/39}{Norman 2013:39})
\par
"MAPPING Mapping is a technical term, borrowed from mathematics, meaning the relationship between the elements of two sets of things." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_XFMMN6JZ/39}{Norman 2013:39})
\par
"Mapping is an important concept in the design and layout of controls and displays. When the mapping uses spatial correspondence between the layout of the controls and the devices being controlled, it is easy to determine how to use them.

Think Design. Think Human.\\
The focus of Don's article is around the discussion of the design. Namely, that everything that is artificial indeed has a design. He cites examples such as the layout of a garden to the intricacies of technological devices. Within this first chapter he identifies and breaks down design into three categories; industrial, interaction, and experiential design. Industrial design is that which focuses on developing concepts and specifications that optimize a product or services value, function or appearance at the benefit of the manufacturer as well as the user. Interaction design focuses on the relationship with technology; what has occurred and why to develop explanations about these interactions. Experience design focus on the quality and the enjoyment of the total experience surround products, processes services, etc. (Norman, 2013).\\
Often if the design is good, there is no issue. However the problem lies when the design is no quite that good leading to frustration by individuals when they cannot adequately get what they wish from the machine. Furthermore it is the precision of the machine combatting the common sense of man that can also lead to difficulties as they can sometimes be opposites of each other. So why does this disconnect occur? If people make machines then why do we run into issues of design? As Norman (2013) states, sometimes the type of people (engineers) who think they are representative of people and how they would interact with the machine are actually not good indicators of the whether the design of the machine is effective. This point is re-iterated by the authors work with Three Mile Island and the insufficient design that led the demise of the nuclear industry here in the U.S.\\
To move away from these issues it is the suggestion of Norman to focus on more human centered design; humans needs first, other design elements come second. This is best accomplished through observation of human behavior as human beings often are unable to tell you what their needs are or what specific difficulties they may encounter. \\
There are several elements Norman mentions in regards to appropriate and well thought out HCD.~ The first two that are discussed are affordances and signifiers. Affordances are possible interactions between people and their environment (Norman, 2013). Signifiers signal affordances and are often used to determine what action can take place due to an affordance. Often people refer to affordances when they really mean signifiers. An example of these two together, think of a touch screen. The relationship of a person's ability to touch the screen is the affordance, a signifier tells the person that touching the screen is possibility and how to engage in a touch screen activity. However for design purposes the signifier is more important than the affordance to ensure good performance (Norman, 2013).\\
Other terms addressed by the author include mapping and feedback. Mapping refers to the relationship between sets of things such as lights and light switches. Mapping allows for individuals to make logical design choices that would be representative of a person's actions using spatial reasoning (i.e. turn right to go right). While they might not always be naturally reflective, as long as individuals understand the action and reaction that occurs between the relationships of the two elements that is what is most important. Feedback is the system of communicating the results of the action or the request that has been submitted. Without feedback, people are left wondering if their request has been received. Feedback needs to be immediate, informative, appropriate, accurate and well executed for it to be productive and useful to the user (Norman, 2013). ~\\
Finally the author addresses conceptual models. Conceptual models are often simplified explanations of~ ~\\
how something works (Norman, 2013). There are often multiple models for a product or device which are included in technical handbooks or manuals for the device to tell the user how to in fact utilize the product or service. However those are often complex, whereas design concept models are simple and are commonly referred to as ``mental models'' (Norman, 2013). These models are often intuitive and valuable in providing understanding of how something works. However, with a concept model, if your concept is incorrect on how something should function, as the author mentions his refrigerator, then it will be impossible to use the product how it is intended based on its design (Norman, 2013).\\
Norman concludes with the paradox of technology and the design challenges that will face us in the future. As we grow, expand, combined and change our devices where will we put all the signifiers? How will know how to work the devices? I think, and I believe Norman would agree, this is where good design that is human centered will be key to technological success and of course be cost effective for the manufacturer.},

\subsection{Conclusion}

\par
This research provides insights into the phenomenon of engagement and is a foundation for further research. We have confirmed and expounded a conceptual model that views engagement as a process in which computer users initiate and sustain engagement, disengage with the application or task, and potentially reengage several times during a single interaction with an application. The process is defined by the presence of multiple attributes that vary in intensity depending on a combination of user and system attributes that emerge during the interaction. We have put forward a model that defines which attributes of engagement are most prominent during each phase in the process. We have highlighted attributes including attention, aesthetics, interest, challenge, control, motivation, novelty, and feedback as the user, system, and interaction components of the compositional, emotional, sensual, and spatiotemporal aspects of users' experience that predict and facilitate engagement. Our work has acknowledged the derivation of engagement from other constructs, such as flow, aesthetic experience, play, and information interaction and concluded that, while it shares attributes with these other frameworks, its combination and expression of components is unique. We have also demonstrated that engagement is consistent across different types of applications in terms of the attributes present and the trajectory followed by users through the process.

"ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement a term not defined consistently in past work as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences."

"In the past few decades, human-computer interaction studies have emphasized the need to move beyond usability to understand and design for more engaging experiences (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Laurel, 1993)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:939})

"Failing to engage users equates with no sale on an electronic commerce site and no transmission of information from a Web site; people go elsewhere to perform their tasks and communicate with colleagues and friends. Successful technologies are not just usable; they engage users." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:939})

"need to engage users and create engaging technologies, there is no agreed upon definition of the construct. Chapman (1997) stated emphasizes playfulness and sensory integration in engagement, which she also refers - (2003) proposed that engagement is a dimension of usability, and is influenced by users' first impression of an application and the enjoyment they derive from using it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})
\par
"Multiple studies of engagement have described it according to different characteristics, such as media presentation, perceived user control, choice, challenge, feedback, and variety (Jacques et al., 1995; Said, 2004; Webster \& Ho, 1997; Chapman, 1997; Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999). Cumulatively, these attributes demonstrate the physical, cognitive, and affective components of user experiences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})
\par
"The objective of this study is to develop an operational definition of engagement and to identify the key components that make up engagement. To do so, we first reviewed and analyzed previous research on engagement, including its use in various application areas and its relationship to other established theories of human-computer interaction. Next we conducted an exploratory study of first-person accounts of engagement with four computer applications: online shopping, Web searching, Webcasting, and video games. We conclude with a model of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})

"LITERATURE REVIEW even essential human response to computer- ). For learning to take place, multimedia presentations should engage their audiences (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995) and educators should critically engage students with technology in the applications. The fervor of discussion about engagement suggests that engaging interactions are sought after by both users and developers of computer systems and applications. Just as we have worked to identify users' perceptions, actions, and attitudes about how to make a system functional and intuitive to use, we must concentrate on understanding how to make systems more engaging. Given the increased emphasis on user experience, it is no longer sufficient to ensure that a system is merely usable (Blythe, Overbeeke, Monk, \& Wright, 2003)."

"Theoretical Underpinnings Prior research has suggested that engagement consists of users' activities, attitudes, (Kappelman, 1995), goals and mental models, and motor skills (Said, 2004), and that it manifests itself in the form of attention, intrinsic interest, curiosity, and motivation (Chapman, 1997). Jacques et al. (1995) looked at a limited number of cognitive and affective variables in relation to the format and display of a specific multimedia system. Said's approach was based on children's interactions with video games, and Chapman's research examined university students' reactions to presentation software. Thus existing frameworks are based on research conducted in specific domains and with particular" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})

"The exception to this is Chapman and colleagues (Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999) who related engagement to flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In addition to flow theory, other theories emerged from our analysis of previous research of user experiences in humancomputer interaction: aesthetic theory (Beardsley, 1982) play theory (Stephenson, 1967), and information interaction (Toms, 2002). We examine all of these theories flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction to inform our understanding of user experiences. seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great mihalyi, 1990, p. 4). Flow theory has been used to explore situational and personality variables associated with computer-based tasks (Woszczynski, Roth, \& Segars, 2002), to predict and design for flow experiences (Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), and to understand users' reactions to and motivations for using applications (Ghani \& Deshpande, 1994; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001). Engagement has that engagement may share some attributes with flow, such as focused attention, feedback, control, activity orientation (i.e., interactivity), and intrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Previous studies indicate that engagement consists of system feedback, user control (Brown \& Cairns, 2004), attention, motivation (Chapman, 1997), and the ability of the system to challenge individuals at levels appropriate to their knowledge and skills (Skelly, Fries, Linnett, Nass, \& Reeves, 1994). Despite the common threads between engagement and flow, we propose that there are differences. Specifically, flow involves intrinsic motivation, yet engaging experiences may come about as well during the nonvoluntary use of a system. Further, flow requires sustained, long-term focus and loss of awareness of the outside world; engagement should still occur in the midst of today's multitasking and dynamic computer environments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:941})
\par
"Jennings (2000) suggested that aesthetic experiences are intrinsically motivating, require focused attention, stimulate curiosity, and are interesting and pleasurable. Some of these attributes, including interest, as well as aesthetics itself, have been associated with engagement (Chapman, 1997). Aesthetics is the visual appearance of the interface as it conforms to design principles (i.e., symmetry, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, rhythm, and unity; Beardsley, 1982). Aesthetic theory has been applied by software developers in interface design (Skelly et al., 1994; Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004). Aesthetics has been linked to usability and users' skills and needs, as well as to the sensory aspects or format of the application (Laurel, 1993; Hummels, 2000, as cited in Overbeeke, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, Wensveen, \& Frens, 2003). As a result, aesthetics is important to engagement, but clearly is only one aspect of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:941})

"Play has been associated with increased frequency and satisfaction of system use (Atkinson \& Kydd), and has been attributed to increased motivation, challenge, and affect (Woszczynski et al., 2002). Thus elements of play are intrinsic to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})

"Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface (Schneiderman, 1997), where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff, 1994). Information interaction is (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ). For the user, this sequence of events or activities occurs when people use systems (Wright, McCarthy, \& Meekison, 2003) and is contingent upon attributes of the user (e.g., motivations, expectations), system (e.g., usability), and contextual or environmental (e.g., organizational culture) characteri-stics (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006), in addition to task (Marchionini, 1995) and content (Toms, 2002). Information interaction provides the connectivity for engagement. The computer system may be aesthetically appealing with design elements that promote play. The user may be susceptible to the state of flow. However, it is the interaction between users and systems operating within a specific context that facilitates an engaging experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})
\par
"Table 1 maps the characteristics that emerge from the literature for flow, aesthetics, play, and information interaction theories. In the final column, we hypothesize which of these attributes may be intrinsic to engagement. Concurrent with these theories, an engaging experience is encouraged by the sensory appeal of the system and the level of feedback and challenge the user receives from the system. Engaged users are affectively involved, motivated, and perceive themselves to be in control over the interaction. However, there are other characteristics inherent in flow, play, aesthetic, and information interaction theories that are unlikely to be present in engagement. Engaging experiences have the attention of the user, but, unlike experiences in flow and aesthetic theories, do not require users to become so focused that they lose their awareness of physical reality. In contrast to flow and play, engagement may not be dependent on the user forming specific goals for the interaction. Users may use an application without any specific purpose or desirable outcome and have an engaging experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})
\par
"While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity. While some of the other frameworks stress the meaningfulness of the experience (i.e., aesthetics and flow), an engaging experience may make a lasting impression but have no more meaning than that the experience was enjoyable or challenging."

However, given the role of affect in both of these contexts (see, e.g., Nahl \& Bilal, 2007; Arnold \& Reynolds, 2003), we can extrapolate that engagement in these areas will be not only purposeful but pleasurable, and that this emotional component will make people more likely to return to a specific product or company Web site (Webster \& Ahuja, 2004). Qualities of Web sites, such as novelty (Toms, 1998; 2000) and aesthetics (Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004; Skelly et al., 1994), as well as feedback, navigability, control, and interactivity (Huang, 2003), have demonstrated that users' needs for both information and entertainment must be satisfied when it comes to engaging searching and shopping experiences.

In addition, it was our belief that there is more to engagement than we could garner by studying the activity itself. We concluded that conducting semistructured interviews was the best method, because it enabled us to delve into the thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of our participants and to allow them to recount a real-life experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/9}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:946})

"A drawback to this methodology is that Wright, 2004), a conclusion reached by Ericsson and Simon (1993) in their analysis of retrospective verbal protocols. As such, it may be biased by users' reflections of events as they relate to other experiences; some details may be withheld or changed since this method relies on accurate recall and depends on what participants deem important or memorable. On the other hand, if an experience was truly memorable, then participants likely remember the details of the experience. Ericsson and Simon further acknowledged that situations of intense cognitive activity, such as that required for the applications we were investigating, tend not to produce useful data when done concurrently with real-time data collection in the form of think-alouds. Given the methodological research in this area, the method we chose was the best given this set of circumstances. Thus, we acknowledge that our interview data is part recall and part interpretation on the part of our participants, but we believe that participants' reflections of their experiences communicate memorable information about the nature of their engagement."

"Based upon our conjecture that engagement is a quality of user experience, we used McCarthy and Wright's (2004) framework for interpreting our results. The four threads of experience are (a) compositional (i.e., beginning, middle, and end); (b) spatiotemporal (i.e., the subtasks being performed as part of participants' application use, such as searching, browsing, comparing information, and communicating with others, as well as their awareness of themselves and their environments, and characteristics of the technology); (c) emotional, (e.g., pleasure, fatigue); (d) sensual (i.e., cognitive [e.g., problem solving], and behavioral [e.g., interactivity] components of the experience). The interview was designed to elicit participants' reactions to each of these components of experience. Specifically we asked them to recount their affective responses, sensory impressions of their environments and the interface, and perceptions of how much time they spent on the computer-based activity.

The outcome of this exploratory study is the identification of four distinct stages of\\
engagement and the attributes that characterize each stage. The point of engagement\\
is initiated by the aesthetic appeal or novel presentation of the interface, the users'\\
motivations and interests, and users' ability and desire to be situated in the interaction\\
and to perceive that there is sufficient time to use the application. Engagement is21\\
sustained when users are able to maintain their attention and interest in the application,\\
and is characterized by positive emotions. Users want to customize the interface to\\
meet their needs and receive appropriate and timely feedback from the application. In\\
addition, they want to lose their perception of time and others during some interactions,\\
but keep their awareness of others in cases where engagement is enhanced by social\\
interaction. Users disengage for many reasons such as the usability of the technology\\
(i.e., challenge and interactivity), and distractions in their environments. This stage,\\
depending on the outcome, resulted in either positive or negative emotions. Figure 1\\

"a single session contains a range of engaging experiences that vary in intensity. Users may be engaged or not engaged, but engagement itself operates on a continuum. In this way it is similar to the construct of usability in that it may be poor, average, or high. The point of engagement may occur at any point during the interaction when users delve beyond the mechanistic or routine level (Norman, Ortony, \& Russel, 2003) and invest themselves in the interaction. We propose that, at this stage, the interface must present information in a novel or aesthetically pleasing way in order to capture users' motivation and interest and situate them in the interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})

Users must be made to feel part of the interaction through an awareness of what the system is doing (feedback) and feeling connected to the technology (interactivity) or to other people (social awareness), and in control over what is happening. The richness of the application generates positive emotions in users. A representation of attributes during this stage is depicted in Figure 1 to convey the dynamic interaction that is taking place during this period. The intensity of these attributes may vary depending on the users' expectations of and experience with the technology, the type of interaction, and the nature of the technology itself."

(1994), who warned that more interface features and choices do not necessarily lead to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/26}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:963})

"Overall, when engagement occurred, participants described cycling through a dynamic process of initiating and sustaining their engagement until internal or external circumstances disengaged them. However, they often experienced multiple engaging episodes during the same session, or returned to the application in subsequent sessions."

These findings both confirm and dispute previous research. We found evidence for more attributes during the engagement phase than Webster and colleagues (Webster \& Ahuja, 2004; Webster \& Ho, 1997) and Jacques et al.

"25 such as convenience and ease of use, the need for information, and novelty were most salient. Users returned to the application because they had past success with it, or it offered them something new (a product or an experience) that could not be obtained elsewhere, and was able to provide adequate levels of control, challenge, and feedback to ensure interviewees were neither bored nor frustrated." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/26}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:963})
\par
"Our findings are inline with other research that has emphasised self-directed, meaningful involvement with materials or applications based on cognitive challenge and motivation (Kearsley \& Schneiderman, 1999) because participants across applications needed personal (e.g., interest) or external incentives (e.g., tangible product, rewards in a game) to continue their tasks and adequate levels of physical or cognitive challenge. Like Carroll and Thomas (1988) and Pausch et al. (1994), our study found that engagement failed to begin or was curtailed when systems were perceived by the user as either too difficult or too easy to use" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"Wells and Matthews (1994) state that attention may be based on the cognitive judgements people make about the relevance of specific stimuli to themselves or their tasks. This was the case with our participants who attended to interface features that would enable them to efficiently complete a task or to content on the interface that resonated with their personal interests." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"velty played an important role in this study in sustaining users' engagements with the applications. For video gamers, this took the form of unexpected auditory or visual stimuli (Aboulafia \& Bannon, 2004); shoppers were interested in seeing new products, and webcast viewers and Web searchers sought new content. However, there was a ceiling for novelty (Webster \& Ho, 1997), because participants did not wish for so much" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"Feedback was shown to be an essential component for inciting and maintaining engagement. Feedback is inextricably linked to communication whether between a human and an artefact, or between several humans using the technology and awareness of others. In the webcast environment, for example, participants underscored their ability to interact with other remote viewers and individuals at the host institution. This is not surprising given people's strong bias for socialization (Picard, 1997). Participants also demonstrated a need for tangible feedback (e.g., textual, visual, or aural) (Pausch et al., 1994) that allowed them to orient themselves in a Web search or game, gauge their success in completing a shopping transaction, and see that their messages were received by others in the Webcasting environment."

\par
"For example, video gamers seemed to have more difficulty disengaging than users of other applications, and were more likely to want more challenging experiences. One area of future research is examining the model more systematically within each of the application domains. Potentially, for example, the intensity of an attribute may vary with the application" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})

"n addition, the specific notion of disengagement is also of interest and pertains to computer addiction Charlton (2002). When, if ever, does intense engagement cross the line into addiction?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})
\par
"There are attributes (e.g., challenge, feedback, perceived control) that are components of not only engagement, but also usability. Future work will examine the relationship between these two constructs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})

"Research and Scholarship My research explores user engagement (UE) with technology.  Specifically, I investigate the conceptual nature of UE (What is it? What attributes of individuals, systems, and contexts facilitate or detract from engagement?), and how to measure it in the context of computer mediated environments. Over the past several years I have focused on two streams of research: theory and measurement.  To this end, I have a) developed a conceptual Process Model of User Engagement and tested/refined it in different computer-mediated environments, and b) created and evaluated the reliability and validity of a 31-item experiential questionnaire, the User Engagement Scale (UES) to measure user engagement with technology (available http://hdl.handle.net/2429/38783). The UES has been adapted by 50+ international research teams who have used it to examine UE with educational technologies, search systems, haptic technologies, health and consumer applications, and other media. In addition, researchers from the following organizations have contacted me to use the UES: Audible.com; US Army RDECOM ARL HRED Advanced Training \& Simulation Division (ATSD); Bell Labs Ireland; Space Human Factors Engineering, Lockheed Martin / NASA Johnson Space Center; User Experience Research AT\&T; Wired@Heart."

Emerging research is focusing on antecedents and outcomes of user engagement in exploratory search contents. I am exploring the ways in which user characteristics, design features, and content predict or facilitate engaging exploratory search experiences; I am also examining the personal and social outcomes of UE in this context, namely learning.

"What is User Engagement? A Conceptual Framework for Defining User Engagement with Technology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/2}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:939})
\par
"ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement a term not defined consistently in past work as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences."

"In the past few decades, human-computer interaction studies have emphasized the need to move beyond usability to understand and design for more engaging experiences (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Laurel, 1993)."

"The objective of this study is to develop an operational definition of engagement and to identify the key components that make up engagement. To do so, we first reviewed and analyzed previous research on engagement, including its use in various application areas and its relationship to other established theories of human-computer interaction. Next we conducted an exploratory study of first-person accounts of engagement with four computer applications: online shopping, Web searching, Webcasting, and video games. We conclude with a model of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:940})

"LITERATURE REVIEW even essential human response to computer- ). For learning to take place, multimedia presentations should engage their audiences (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995) and educators should critically engage students with technology in the applications. The fervor of discussion about engagement suggests that engaging interactions are sought after by both users and developers of computer systems and applications. Just as we have worked to identify users' perceptions, actions, and attitudes about how to make a system functional and intuitive to use, we must concentrate on understanding how to make systems more engaging. Given the increased emphasis on user experience, it is no longer sufficient to ensure that a system is merely usable (Blythe, Overbeeke, Monk, \& Wright, 2003)."

"Theoretical Underpinnings Prior research has suggested that engagement consists of users' activities, attitudes, (Kappelman, 1995), goals and mental models, and motor skills (Said, 2004), and that it manifests itself in the form of attention, intrinsic interest, curiosity, and motivation (Chapman, 1997). Jacques et al. (1995) looked at a limited number of cognitive and affective variables in relation to the format and display of a specific multimedia system. Said's approach was based on children's interactions with video games, and Chapman's research examined university students' reactions to presentation software.

"The exception to this is Chapman and colleagues (Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999) who related engagement to flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In addition to flow theory, other theories emerged from our analysis of previous research of user experiences in humancomputer interaction: aesthetic theory (Beardsley, 1982) play theory (Stephenson, 1967), and information interaction (Toms, 2002). We examine all of these theories flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction to inform our understanding of user experiences. seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great mihalyi, 1990, p. 4). Flow theory has been used to explore situational and personality variables associated with computer-based tasks (Woszczynski, Roth, \& Segars, 2002), to predict and design for flow experiences (Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), and to understand users' reactions to and motivations for using applications (Ghani \& Deshpande, 1994; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001). Engagement has that engagement may share some attributes with flow, such as focused attention, feedback, control, activity orientation (i.e., interactivity), and intrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Previous studies indicate that engagement consists of system feedback, user control (Brown \& Cairns, 2004), attention, motivation (Chapman, 1997), and the ability of the system to challenge individuals at levels appropriate to their knowledge and skills (Skelly, Fries, Linnett, Nass, \& Reeves, 1994). Despite the common threads between engagement and flow, we propose that there are differences. Specifically, flow involves intrinsic motivation, yet engaging experiences may come about as well during the nonvoluntary use of a system. Further, flow requires sustained, long-term focus and loss of awareness of the outside world; engagement should still occur in the midst of today's multitasking and dynamic computer environments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:941})

"Jennings (2000) suggested that aesthetic experiences are intrinsically motivating, require focused attention, stimulate curiosity, and are interesting and pleasurable. Some of these attributes, including interest, as well as aesthetics itself, have been associated with engagement (Chapman, 1997). Aesthetics is the visual appearance of the interface as it conforms to design principles (i.e., symmetry, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, rhythm, and unity; Beardsley, 1982). Aesthetic theory has been applied by software developers in interface design (Skelly et al., 1994; Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004). Aesthetics has been linked to usability and users' skills and needs, as well as to the sensory aspects or format of the application (Laurel, 1993; Hummels, 2000, as cited in Overbeeke, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, Wensveen, \& Frens, 2003). As a result, aesthetics is important to engagement, but clearly is only one aspect of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:941})

"Play has been associated with increased frequency and satisfaction of system use (Atkinson \& Kydd), and has been attributed to increased motivation, challenge, and affect (Woszczynski et al., 2002). Thus elements of play are intrinsic to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:942})

"Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface (Schneiderman, 1997), where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff, 1994). Information interaction is (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ). For the user, this sequence of events or activities occurs when people use systems (Wright, McCarthy, \& Meekison, 2003) and is contingent upon attributes of the user (e.g., motivations, expectations), system (e.g., usability), and contextual or environmental (e.g., organizational culture) characteri-stics (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006), in addition to task (Marchionini, 1995) and content (Toms, 2002). Information interaction provides the connectivity for engagement. The computer system may be aesthetically appealing with design elements that promote play. The user may be susceptible to the state of flow. However, it is the interaction between users and systems operating within a specific context that facilitates an engaging experience."

\par
"Table 1 maps the characteristics that emerge from the literature for flow, aesthetics, play, and information interaction theories. In the final column, we hypothesize which of these attributes may be intrinsic to engagement. Concurrent with these theories, an engaging experience is encouraged by the sensory appeal of the system and the level of feedback and challenge the user receives from the system. Engaged users are affectively involved, motivated, and perceive themselves to be in control over the interaction. However, there are other characteristics inherent in flow, play, aesthetic, and information interaction theories that are unlikely to be present in engagement. Engaging experiences have the attention of the user, but, unlike experiences in flow and aesthetic theories, do not require users to become so focused that they lose their awareness of physical reality. In contrast to flow and play, engagement may not be dependent on the user forming specific goals for the interaction. Users may use an application without any specific purpose or desirable outcome and have an engaging experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:942})

"While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity. While some of the other frameworks stress the meaningfulness of the experience (i.e., aesthetics and flow), an engaging experience may make a lasting impression but have no more meaning than that the experience was enjoyable or challenging."

"Engagement has rarely been examined in online shopping and search applications. However, given the role of affect in both of these contexts (see, e.g., Nahl \& Bilal, 2007; Arnold \& Reynolds, 2003), we can extrapolate that engagement in these areas will be not only purposeful but pleasurable, and that this emotional component will make people more likely to return to a specific product or company Web site (Webster \& Ahuja, 2004). Qualities of Web sites, such as novelty (Toms, 1998; 2000) and aesthetics (Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004; Skelly et al., 1994), as well as feedback, navigability, control, and interactivity (Huang, 2003), have demonstrated that users' needs for both information and entertainment must be satisfied when it comes to engaging searching and shopping experiences. Poor Web site design and usability may Web searching is hampered by a Web site's poor navigational structure, users are left feeling disoriented and frustrated (Atkinson \& Kydd, 1997; Webster \& Ahuja, 2004), and that they lack control over the interaction (Rozell \& Gardner, 2000)."

"METHODOLOGY There are a variety of methods that we might have employed to study this construct, including surveys, participant observation, and so forth. However, due to the exploratory nature of our research, we could not be confident in creating questionnaire items or classifying observed behaviors. Nor could we be certain that studying this phenomenon while participants were actively engaged would not interfere with their experiences. In addition, it was our belief that there is more to engagement than we could garner by studying the activity itself. We concluded that conducting semistructured interviews was the best method, because it enabled us to delve into the thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of our participants and to allow them to recount a real-life experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/9}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:946})

"A drawback to this methodology is that Wright, 2004), a conclusion reached by Ericsson and Simon (1993) in their analysis of retrospective verbal protocols. As such, it may be biased by users' reflections of events as they relate to other experiences; some details may be withheld or changed since this method relies on accurate recall and depends on what participants deem important or memorable. On the other hand, if an experience was truly memorable, then participants likely remember the details of the experience. Ericsson and Simon further acknowledged that situations of intense cognitive activity, such as that required for the applications we were investigating, tend not to produce useful data when done concurrently with real-time data collection in the form of think-alouds. Given the methodological research in this area, the method we chose was the best given this set of circumstances. Thus, we acknowledge that our interview data is part recall and part interpretation on the part of our participants, but we believe that participants' reflections of their experiences communicate memorable information about the nature of their engagement."

The interview was designed to elicit participants' reactions to each of these components of experience. Specifically we asked them to recount their affective responses, sensory impressions of their environments and the interface, and perceptions of how much time they spent on the computer-based activity.

They also reengaged after they had abandoned their tasks to see to personal needs, take time to consider and compare information, or switch tasks.

The other threads of experience, sensual, emotional, and spatiotemporal, were present in the engagement experience. Although some examples of these threads are embedded in our discussion of the engagement process, we summarize them in the following sections" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/18}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:955})

\emph{A PROPOSED MODEL OF ENGAGEMENT\\
The outcome of this exploratory study is the identification of four distinct stages of\\
engagement and the attributes that characterize each stage. The point of engagement\\
is initiated by the aesthetic appeal or novel presentation of the interface, the users'\\
motivations and interests, and users' ability and desire to be situated in the interaction\\
and to perceive that there is sufficient time to use the application. Engagement is21\\
sustained when users are able to maintain their attention and interest in the application,\\
and is characterized by positive emotions. Users want to customize the interface to\\
meet their needs and receive appropriate and timely feedback from the application. In\\
addition, they want to lose their perception of time and others during some interactions,\\
but keep their awareness of others in cases where engagement is enhanced by social\\
interaction. Users disengage for many reasons such as the usability of the technology\\
(i.e., challenge and interactivity), and distractions in their environments. This stage,\\
depending on the outcome, resulted in either positive or negative emotions. Figure 1\\

\par
"a single session contains a range of engaging experiences that vary in intensity. Users may be engaged or not engaged, but engagement itself operates on a continuum. In this way it is similar to the construct of usability in that it may be poor, average, or high. The point of engagement may occur at any point during the interaction when users delve beyond the mechanistic or routine level (Norman, Ortony, \& Russel, 2003) and invest themselves in the interaction. We propose that, at this stage, the interface must present information in a novel or aesthetically pleasing way in order to capture users' motivation and interest and situate them in the interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:960})

\par
"Our research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained. Users must be made to feel part of the interaction through an awareness of what the system is doing (feedback) and feeling connected to the technology (interactivity) or to other people (social awareness), and in control over what is happening. The richness of the application generates positive emotions in users. A representation of attributes during this stage is depicted in Figure 1 to convey the dynamic interaction that is taking place during this period. The intensity of these attributes may vary depending on the users' expectations of and experience with the technology, the type of interaction, and the nature of the technology itself."

"Previous frameworks of engagement have emphasized what users are doing and thinking (e.g., Said, 2004) or feeling (Kappelman, 1995). The first contribution of our model is that it is holistic and presents the behaviors, cognitions, and emotions of users in the context of content, design, and interactive features of the application."

"engagement has not been explicitly identified as a process. Chapman (1997) examined which may equate with our point of engagement stage but most researchers have not articulated engagement as having a beginning, middle, and end, nor what attributes might characterize each of these stages. The idea of reengagement that may occur during the same session with an application or at a future time is novel. The second contribution of this model is that we have linked attributes of engagement to each stage of the process. We have considered all of the disparate engagement attributes, and we have identified which attributes are most significant to particular stages of the engagement process."

"The research objectives of this study were to conceptually and operationally define engagement. We proposed that engaging systems extend beyond usability of the application. Using flow, aesthetic, play and information interaction theories as our foundation, we discovered that the attributes of engagement challenge, affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, perceived control, and interactivity are products of the user-system interaction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:961})
\par
"Previous work suggested that challenge, pleasure, endurability, attention, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, variety/novelty, interest, interactivity, and perceived user control were attributes of engagement. We confirmed the presence of these attributes in the engagement process. In addition, we discovered that awareness of others and one's environment, and perception of time, were also part of engaging experiences. Thus, we have expanded our original definition of engagement to include these additional attributes: Engagement is a quality of user experiences with technology that is characterized by challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect."

"Goal setting was put forward by Said (2004) as an untapped variable to consider for engagement.

"Although Webster and Ho (1997) found evidence for higher levels of engagement with more interactive applications, the amount of interactivity was not indicative of engagement in this study.

"Our findings are inline with other research that has emphasised self-directed, meaningful involvement with materials or applications based on cognitive challenge and motivation (Kearsley \& Schneiderman, 1999) because participants across applications needed personal (e.g., interest) or external incentives (e.g., tangible product, rewards in a game) to continue their tasks and adequate levels of physical or cognitive challenge. Like Carroll and Thomas (1988) and Pausch et al. (1994), our study found that engagement failed to begin or was curtailed when systems were perceived by the user as either too difficult or too easy to use" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien-Toms 2008:964})

"velty played an important role in this study in sustaining users' engagements with the applications. For video gamers, this took the form of unexpected auditory or visual stimuli (Aboulafia \& Bannon, 2004); shoppers were interested in seeing new products, and webcast viewers and Web searchers sought new content.

"Feedback was shown to be an essential component for inciting and maintaining engagement. Feedback is inextricably linked to communication whether between a human and an artefact, or between several humans using the technology and awareness of others. In the webcast environment, for example, participants underscored their ability to interact with other remote viewers and individuals at the host institution. This is not surprising given people's strong bias for socialization (Picard, 1997). Participants also demonstrated a need for tangible feedback (e.g., textual, visual, or aural) (Pausch et al., 1994) that allowed them to orient themselves in a Web search or game, gauge their success in completing a shopping transaction, and see that their messages were received by others in the Webcasting environment."

\par
"ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement a term not defined consistently in past work as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences."

"In the past few decades, human-computer interaction studies have emphasized the need to move beyond usability to understand and design for more engaging experiences (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Laurel, 1993)."

For learning to take place, multimedia presentations should engage their audiences (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995) and educators should critically engage students with technology in the applications. The fervor of discussion about engagement suggests that engaging interactions are sought after by both users and developers of computer systems and applications. Just as we have worked to identify users' perceptions, actions, and attitudes about how to make a system functional and intuitive to use, we must concentrate on understanding how to make systems more engaging. Given the increased emphasis on user experience, it is no longer sufficient to ensure that a system is merely usable (Blythe, Overbeeke, Monk, \& Wright, 2003)."

"Theoretical Underpinnings Prior research has suggested that engagement consists of users' activities, attitudes, (Kappelman, 1995), goals and mental models, and motor skills (Said, 2004), and that it manifests itself in the form of attention, intrinsic interest, curiosity, and motivation (Chapman, 1997). Jacques et al. (1995) looked at a limited number of cognitive and affective variables in relation to the format and display of a specific multimedia system. Said's approach was based on children's interactions with video games, and Chapman's research examined university students' reactions to presentation software.

"The exception to this is Chapman and colleagues (Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999) who related engagement to flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In addition to flow theory, other theories emerged from our analysis of previous research of user experiences in humancomputer interaction: aesthetic theory (Beardsley, 1982) play theory (Stephenson, 1967), and information interaction (Toms, 2002). We examine all of these theories flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction to inform our understanding of user experiences. seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great mihalyi, 1990, p. 4). Flow theory has been used to explore situational and personality variables associated with computer-based tasks (Woszczynski, Roth, \& Segars, 2002), to predict and design for flow experiences (Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), and to understand users' reactions to and motivations for using applications (Ghani \& Deshpande, 1994; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001). Engagement has that engagement may share some attributes with flow, such as focused attention, feedback, control, activity orientation (i.e., interactivity), and intrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Previous studies indicate that engagement consists of system feedback, user control (Brown \& Cairns, 2004), attention, motivation (Chapman, 1997), and the ability of the system to challenge individuals at levels appropriate to their knowledge and skills (Skelly, Fries, Linnett, Nass, \& Reeves, 1994). Despite the common threads between engagement and flow, we propose that there are differences. Specifically, flow involves intrinsic motivation, yet engaging experiences may come about as well during the nonvoluntary use of a system. Further, flow requires sustained, long-term focus and loss of awareness of the outside world; engagement should still occur in the midst of today's multitasking and dynamic computer environments."

"Jennings (2000) suggested that aesthetic experiences are intrinsically motivating, require focused attention, stimulate curiosity, and are interesting and pleasurable. Some of these attributes, including interest, as well as aesthetics itself, have been associated with engagement (Chapman, 1997). Aesthetics is the visual appearance of the interface as it conforms to design principles (i.e., symmetry, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, rhythm, and unity; Beardsley, 1982). Aesthetic theory has been applied by software developers in interface design (Skelly et al., 1994; Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004). Aesthetics has been linked to usability and users' skills and needs, as well as to the sensory aspects or format of the application (Laurel, 1993; Hummels, 2000, as cited in Overbeeke, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, Wensveen, \& Frens, 2003). As a result, aesthetics is important to engagement, but clearly is only one aspect of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:941})

"Play has been associated with increased frequency and satisfaction of system use (Atkinson \& Kydd), and has been attributed to increased motivation, challenge, and affect (Woszczynski et al., 2002). Thus elements of play are intrinsic to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})

"Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface (Schneiderman, 1997), where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff, 1994). Information interaction is (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ). For the user, this sequence of events or activities occurs when people use systems (Wright, McCarthy, \& Meekison, 2003) and is contingent upon attributes of the user (e.g., motivations, expectations), system (e.g., usability), and contextual or environmental (e.g., organizational culture) characteri-stics (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006), in addition to task (Marchionini, 1995) and content (Toms, 2002). Information interaction provides the connectivity for engagement. The computer system may be aesthetically appealing with design elements that promote play. The user may be susceptible to the state of flow. However, it is the interaction between users and systems operating within a specific context that facilitates an engaging experience."

\par
"Table 1 maps the characteristics that emerge from the literature for flow, aesthetics, play, and information interaction theories. In the final column, we hypothesize which of these attributes may be intrinsic to engagement. Concurrent with these theories, an engaging experience is encouraged by the sensory appeal of the system and the level of feedback and challenge the user receives from the system. Engaged users are affectively involved, motivated, and perceive themselves to be in control over the interaction. However, there are other characteristics inherent in flow, play, aesthetic, and information interaction theories that are unlikely to be present in engagement. Engaging experiences have the attention of the user, but, unlike experiences in flow and aesthetic theories, do not require users to become so focused that they lose their awareness of physical reality. In contrast to flow and play, engagement may not be dependent on the user forming specific goals for the interaction. Users may use an application without any specific purpose or desirable outcome and have an engaging experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})

"While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity.

"METHODOLOGY There are a variety of methods that we might have employed to study this construct, including surveys, participant observation, and so forth. However, due to the exploratory nature of our research, we could not be confident in creating questionnaire items or classifying observed behaviors. Nor could we be certain that studying this phenomenon while participants were actively engaged would not interfere with their experiences. In addition, it was our belief that there is more to engagement than we could garner by studying the activity itself. We concluded that conducting semistructured interviews was the best method, because it enabled us to delve into the thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of our participants and to allow them to recount a real-life experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/9}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:946})

"A drawback to this methodology is that Wright, 2004), a conclusion reached by Ericsson and Simon (1993) in their analysis of retrospective verbal protocols. As such, it may be biased by users' reflections of events as they relate to other experiences; some details may be withheld or changed since this method relies on accurate recall and depends on what participants deem important or memorable. On the other hand, if an experience was truly memorable, then participants likely remember the details of the experience. Ericsson and Simon further acknowledged that situations of intense cognitive activity, such as that required for the applications we were investigating, tend not to produce useful data when done concurrently with real-time data collection in the form of think-alouds. Given the methodological research in this area, the method we chose was the best given this set of circumstances. Thus, we acknowledge that our interview data is part recall and part interpretation on the part of our participants, but we believe that participants' reflections of their experiences communicate memorable information about the nature of their engagement."

The interview was designed to elicit participants' reactions to each of these components of experience. Specifically we asked them to recount their affective responses, sensory impressions of their environments and the interface, and perceptions of how much time they spent on the computer-based activity.

meet their needs and receive appropriate and timely feedback from the application. In\\
addition, they want to lose their perception of time and others during some interactions,\\
but keep their awareness of others in cases where engagement is enhanced by social\\
interaction. Users disengage for many reasons such as the usability of the technology\\
(i.e., challenge and interactivity), and distractions in their environments. This stage,\\

In this way it is similar to the construct of usability in that it may be poor, average, or high. The point of engagement may occur at any point during the interaction when users delve beyond the mechanistic or routine level (Norman, Ortony, \& Russel, 2003) and invest themselves in the interaction.

"Our research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained. Users must be made to feel part of the interaction through an awareness of what the system is doing (feedback) and feeling connected to the technology (interactivity) or to other people (social awareness), and in control over what is happening. The richness of the application generates positive emotions in users. A representation of attributes during this stage is depicted in Figure 1 to convey the dynamic interaction that is taking place during this period. The intensity of these attributes may vary depending on the users' expectations of and experience with the technology, the type of interaction, and the nature of the technology itself."

"Although Webster and Ho (1997) found evidence for higher levels of engagement with more interactive applications, the amount of interactivity was not indicative of engagement in this study.

In the webcast environment, for example, participants underscored their ability to interact with other remote viewers and individuals at the host institution. This is not surprising given people's strong bias for socialization (Picard, 1997). Participants also demonstrated a need for tangible feedback (e.g., textual, visual, or aural) (Pausch et al., 1994) that allowed them to orient themselves in a Web search or game, gauge their success in completing a shopping transaction, and see that their messages were received by others in the Webcasting environment."

\par
"Research and Scholarship My research explores user engagement (UE) with technology.  Specifically, I investigate the conceptual nature of UE (What is it? What attributes of individuals, systems, and contexts facilitate or detract from engagement?), and how to measure it in the context of computer mediated environments. Over the past several years I have focused on two streams of research: theory and measurement.  To this end, I have a) developed a conceptual Process Model of User Engagement and tested/refined it in different computer-mediated environments, and b) created and evaluated the reliability and validity of a 31-item experiential questionnaire, the User Engagement Scale (UES) to measure user engagement with technology (available http://hdl.handle.net/2429/38783). The UES has been adapted by 50+ international research teams who have used it to examine UE with educational technologies, search systems, haptic technologies, health and consumer applications, and other media. In addition, researchers from the following organizations have contacted me to use the UES: Audible.com; US Army RDECOM ARL HRED Advanced Training \& Simulation Division (ATSD); Bell Labs Ireland; Space Human Factors Engineering, Lockheed Martin / NASA Johnson Space Center; User Experience Research AT\&T; Wired@Heart."

"Collectively, this work has led to productive collaborations with academic and industry researchers.  Since 2008, my research program has generated 1 authored and 1 edited book; 11 published referred journal articles, 2 accepted and 2 in progress, 36 published referred conference full, poster and panel papers, 5 book chapters and 2 in progress, as well as several invited presentations. Emerging research is focusing on antecedents and outcomes of user engagement in exploratory search contents. I am exploring the ways in which user characteristics, design features, and content predict or facilitate engaging exploratory search experiences; I am also examining the personal and social outcomes of UE in this context, namely learning. This work will inform the design of exploratory search systems and contribute further to the understanding and measurement of user experience."

"Doctoral Dissertation:  Defining and Measuring Engagement in User Experiences with Technology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_3XBZHQVV/1}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:938})
\par
"Research and Scholarship My research explores user engagement (UE) with technology.  Specifically, I investigate the conceptual nature of UE (What is it? What attributes of individuals, systems, and contexts facilitate or detract from engagement?), and how to measure it in the context of computer mediated environments. Over the past several years I have focused on two streams of research: theory and measurement.  To this end, I have a) developed a conceptual Process Model of User Engagement and tested/refined it in different computer-mediated environments, and b) created and evaluated the reliability and validity of a 31-item experiential questionnaire, the User Engagement Scale (UES) to measure user engagement with technology (available http://hdl.handle.net/2429/38783). The UES has been adapted by 50+ international research teams who have used it to examine UE with educational technologies, search systems, haptic technologies, health and consumer applications, and other media. In addition, researchers from the following organizations have contacted me to use the UES: Audible.com; US Army RDECOM ARL HRED Advanced Training \& Simulation Division (ATSD); Bell Labs Ireland; Space Human Factors Engineering, Lockheed Martin / NASA Johnson Space Center; User Experience Research AT\&T; Wired@Heart."

"Collectively, this work has led to productive collaborations with academic and industry researchers.  Since 2008, my research program has generated 1 authored and 1 edited book; 11 published referred journal articles, 2 accepted and 2 in progress, 36 published referred conference full, poster and panel papers, 5 book chapters and 2 in progress, as well as several invited presentations. Emerging research is focusing on antecedents and outcomes of user engagement in exploratory search contents. I am exploring the ways in which user characteristics, design features, and content predict or facilitate engaging exploratory search experiences; I am also examining the personal and social outcomes of UE in this context, namely learning. This work will inform the design of exploratory search systems and contribute further to the understanding and measurement of user experience."

\par
"ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement a term not defined consistently in past work as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences."

"In the past few decades, human-computer interaction studies have emphasized the need to move beyond usability to understand and design for more engaging experiences (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Laurel, 1993)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:939})

"Failing to engage users equates with no sale on an electronic commerce site and no transmission of information from a Web site; people go elsewhere to perform their tasks and communicate with colleagues and friends. Successful technologies are not just usable; they engage users." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:939})

"need to engage users and create engaging technologies, there is no agreed upon definition of the construct. Chapman (1997) stated emphasizes playfulness and sensory integration in engagement, which she also refers - (2003) proposed that engagement is a dimension of usability, and is influenced by users' first impression of an application and the enjoyment they derive from using it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})
\par
"Multiple studies of engagement have described it according to different characteristics, such as media presentation, perceived user control, choice, challenge, feedback, and variety (Jacques et al., 1995; Said, 2004; Webster \& Ho, 1997; Chapman, 1997; Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999). Cumulatively, these attributes demonstrate the physical, cognitive, and affective components of user experiences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})
\par
"The objective of this study is to develop an operational definition of engagement and to identify the key components that make up engagement. To do so, we first reviewed and analyzed previous research on engagement, including its use in various application areas and its relationship to other established theories of human-computer interaction. Next we conducted an exploratory study of first-person accounts of engagement with four computer applications: online shopping, Web searching, Webcasting, and video games. We conclude with a model of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})

"LITERATURE REVIEW even essential human response to computer- ). For learning to take place, multimedia presentations should engage their audiences (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995) and educators should critically engage students with technology in the applications. The fervor of discussion about engagement suggests that engaging interactions are sought after by both users and developers of computer systems and applications. Just as we have worked to identify users' perceptions, actions, and attitudes about how to make a system functional and intuitive to use, we must concentrate on understanding how to make systems more engaging. Given the increased emphasis on user experience, it is no longer sufficient to ensure that a system is merely usable (Blythe, Overbeeke, Monk, \& Wright, 2003)."

"Theoretical Underpinnings Prior research has suggested that engagement consists of users' activities, attitudes, (Kappelman, 1995), goals and mental models, and motor skills (Said, 2004), and that it manifests itself in the form of attention, intrinsic interest, curiosity, and motivation (Chapman, 1997). Jacques et al. (1995) looked at a limited number of cognitive and affective variables in relation to the format and display of a specific multimedia system. Said's approach was based on children's interactions with video games, and Chapman's research examined university students' reactions to presentation software. Thus existing frameworks are based on research conducted in specific domains and with particular" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:940})

"The exception to this is Chapman and colleagues (Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999) who related engagement to flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In addition to flow theory, other theories emerged from our analysis of previous research of user experiences in humancomputer interaction: aesthetic theory (Beardsley, 1982) play theory (Stephenson, 1967), and information interaction (Toms, 2002). We examine all of these theories flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction to inform our understanding of user experiences. seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great mihalyi, 1990, p. 4). Flow theory has been used to explore situational and personality variables associated with computer-based tasks (Woszczynski, Roth, \& Segars, 2002), to predict and design for flow experiences (Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), and to understand users' reactions to and motivations for using applications (Ghani \& Deshpande, 1994; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001). Engagement has that engagement may share some attributes with flow, such as focused attention, feedback, control, activity orientation (i.e., interactivity), and intrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Previous studies indicate that engagement consists of system feedback, user control (Brown \& Cairns, 2004), attention, motivation (Chapman, 1997), and the ability of the system to challenge individuals at levels appropriate to their knowledge and skills (Skelly, Fries, Linnett, Nass, \& Reeves, 1994). Despite the common threads between engagement and flow, we propose that there are differences. Specifically, flow involves intrinsic motivation, yet engaging experiences may come about as well during the nonvoluntary use of a system. Further, flow requires sustained, long-term focus and loss of awareness of the outside world; engagement should still occur in the midst of today's multitasking and dynamic computer environments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:941})
\par
"Jennings (2000) suggested that aesthetic experiences are intrinsically motivating, require focused attention, stimulate curiosity, and are interesting and pleasurable. Some of these attributes, including interest, as well as aesthetics itself, have been associated with engagement (Chapman, 1997). Aesthetics is the visual appearance of the interface as it conforms to design principles (i.e., symmetry, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, rhythm, and unity; Beardsley, 1982). Aesthetic theory has been applied by software developers in interface design (Skelly et al., 1994; Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004). Aesthetics has been linked to usability and users' skills and needs, as well as to the sensory aspects or format of the application (Laurel, 1993; Hummels, 2000, as cited in Overbeeke, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, Wensveen, \& Frens, 2003). As a result, aesthetics is important to engagement, but clearly is only one aspect of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/4}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:941})

"Play has been associated with increased frequency and satisfaction of system use (Atkinson \& Kydd), and has been attributed to increased motivation, challenge, and affect (Woszczynski et al., 2002). Thus elements of play are intrinsic to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})

"Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface (Schneiderman, 1997), where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff, 1994). Information interaction is (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ). For the user, this sequence of events or activities occurs when people use systems (Wright, McCarthy, \& Meekison, 2003) and is contingent upon attributes of the user (e.g., motivations, expectations), system (e.g., usability), and contextual or environmental (e.g., organizational culture) characteri-stics (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006), in addition to task (Marchionini, 1995) and content (Toms, 2002). Information interaction provides the connectivity for engagement. The computer system may be aesthetically appealing with design elements that promote play. The user may be susceptible to the state of flow. However, it is the interaction between users and systems operating within a specific context that facilitates an engaging experience."

Concurrent with these theories, an engaging experience is encouraged by the sensory appeal of the system and the level of feedback and challenge the user receives from the system. Engaged users are affectively involved, motivated, and perceive themselves to be in control over the interaction. However, there are other characteristics inherent in flow, play, aesthetic, and information interaction theories that are unlikely to be present in engagement. Engaging experiences have the attention of the user, but, unlike experiences in flow and aesthetic theories, do not require users to become so focused that they lose their awareness of physical reality. In contrast to flow and play, engagement may not be dependent on the user forming specific goals for the interaction. Users may use an application without any specific purpose or desirable outcome and have an engaging experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})

"While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity. While some of the other frameworks stress the meaningfulness of the experience (i.e., aesthetics and flow), an engaging experience may make a lasting impression but have no more meaning than that the experience was enjoyable or challenging."

"METHODOLOGY There are a variety of methods that we might have employed to study this construct, including surveys, participant observation, and so forth. However, due to the exploratory nature of our research, we could not be confident in creating questionnaire items or classifying observed behaviors. Nor could we be certain that studying this phenomenon while participants were actively engaged would not interfere with their experiences. In addition, it was our belief that there is more to engagement than we could garner by studying the activity itself. We concluded that conducting semistructured interviews was the best method, because it enabled us to delve into the thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of our participants and to allow them to recount a real-life experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/9}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:946})

"A drawback to this methodology is that Wright, 2004), a conclusion reached by Ericsson and Simon (1993) in their analysis of retrospective verbal protocols. As such, it may be biased by users' reflections of events as they relate to other experiences; some details may be withheld or changed since this method relies on accurate recall and depends on what participants deem important or memorable. On the other hand, if an experience was truly memorable, then participants likely remember the details of the experience. Ericsson and Simon further acknowledged that situations of intense cognitive activity, such as that required for the applications we were investigating, tend not to produce useful data when done concurrently with real-time data collection in the form of think-alouds. Given the methodological research in this area, the method we chose was the best given this set of circumstances. Thus, we acknowledge that our interview data is part recall and part interpretation on the part of our participants, but we believe that participants' reflections of their experiences communicate memorable information about the nature of their engagement."

The interview was designed to elicit participants' reactions to each of these components of experience. Specifically we asked them to recount their affective responses, sensory impressions of their environments and the interface, and perceptions of how much time they spent on the computer-based activity.

\emph{A PROPOSED MODEL OF ENGAGEMENT\\
The outcome of this exploratory study is the identification of four distinct stages of\\
engagement and the attributes that characterize each stage. The point of engagement\\
is initiated by the aesthetic appeal or novel presentation of the interface, the users'\\
motivations and interests, and users' ability and desire to be situated in the interaction\\
and to perceive that there is sufficient time to use the application. Engagement is21\\
sustained when users are able to maintain their attention and interest in the application,\\
and is characterized by positive emotions. Users want to customize the interface to\\
meet their needs and receive appropriate and timely feedback from the application. In\\
addition, they want to lose their perception of time and others during some interactions,\\
but keep their awareness of others in cases where engagement is enhanced by social\\
interaction. Users disengage for many reasons such as the usability of the technology\\
(i.e., challenge and interactivity), and distractions in their environments. This stage,\\
depending on the outcome, resulted in either positive or negative emotions. Figure 1\\
illustrates the model (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/21}{note on p.958})}

\par
"a single session contains a range of engaging experiences that vary in intensity. Users may be engaged or not engaged, but engagement itself operates on a continuum. In this way it is similar to the construct of usability in that it may be poor, average, or high. The point of engagement may occur at any point during the interaction when users delve beyond the mechanistic or routine level (Norman, Ortony, \& Russel, 2003) and invest themselves in the interaction. We propose that, at this stage, the interface must present information in a novel or aesthetically pleasing way in order to capture users' motivation and interest and situate them in the interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})

"Our research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})
\par
"Our research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained. Users must be made to feel part of the interaction through an awareness of what the system is doing (feedback) and feeling connected to the technology (interactivity) or to other people (social awareness), and in control over what is happening. The richness of the application generates positive emotions in users. A representation of attributes during this stage is depicted in Figure 1 to convey the dynamic interaction that is taking place during this period. The intensity of these attributes may vary depending on the users' expectations of and experience with the technology, the type of interaction, and the nature of the technology itself." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})
\par
"Previous frameworks of engagement have emphasized what users are doing and thinking (e.g., Said, 2004) or feeling (Kappelman, 1995). The first contribution of our model is that it is holistic and presents the behaviors, cognitions, and emotions of users in the context of content, design, and interactive features of the application."

\par
"engagement has not been explicitly identified as a process. Chapman (1997) examined which may equate with our point of engagement stage but most researchers have not articulated engagement as having a beginning, middle, and end, nor what attributes might characterize each of these stages. The idea of reengagement that may occur during the same session with an application or at a future time is novel. The second contribution of this model is that we have linked attributes of engagement to each stage of the process. We have considered all of the disparate engagement attributes, and we have identified which attributes are most significant to particular stages of the engagement process."

"The research objectives of this study were to conceptually and operationally define engagement. We proposed that engaging systems extend beyond usability of the application. Using flow, aesthetic, play and information interaction theories as our foundation, we discovered that the attributes of engagement challenge, affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, perceived control, and interactivity are products of the user-system interaction."

We confirmed the presence of these attributes in the engagement process. In addition, we discovered that awareness of others and one's environment, and perception of time, were also part of engaging experiences. Thus, we have expanded our original definition of engagement to include these additional attributes: Engagement is a quality of user experiences with technology that is characterized by challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect."

However, we also saw the role of affect in positive and negative emotions, a finding similar to Kappelman (1995), who identified attitude as a major component of his product/process matrix of system involvement.

"Although Webster and Ho (1997) found evidence for higher levels of engagement with more interactive applications, the amount of interactivity was not indicative of engagement in this study. Rather, it was the quality and appropriateness of the interactivity to the user's task that precipitated engagement. This is supported by Jacques et al. (1995), who found that students' preferences for visualor text-based educational multimedia depended on the task they needed to perform, and by Skelly et al. (1994), who warned that more interface features and choices do not necessarily lead to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/26}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:963})

This is not surprising given people's strong bias for socialization (Picard, 1997). Participants also demonstrated a need for tangible feedback (e.g., textual, visual, or aural) (Pausch et al., 1994) that allowed them to orient themselves in a Web search or game, gauge their success in completing a shopping transaction, and see that their messages were received by others in the Webcasting environment."

"28 that defines which attributes of engagement are most prominent during each phase in the process. We have highlighted attributes including attention, aesthetics, interest, challenge, control, motivation, novelty, and feedback as the user, system, and interaction components of the compositional, emotional, sensual, and spatiotemporal aspects of users' experience that predict and facilitate engagement. Our work has acknowledged the derivation of engagement from other constructs, such as flow, aesthetic experience, play, and information interaction and concluded that, while it shares attributes with these other frameworks, its combination and expression of components is unique. We have also demonstrated that engagement is consistent across different types of applications in terms of the attributes present and the trajectory followed by users through the process."

"Doctoral Dissertation: Defining and Measuring Engagement in User Experiences with Technology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_3XBZHQVV/1}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:938})
\par
"Research and Scholarship My research explores user engagement (UE) with technology. Specifically, I investigate the conceptual nature of UE (What is it? What attributes of individuals, systems, and contexts facilitate or detract from engagement?), and how to measure it in the context of computer mediated environments. Over the past several years I have focused on two streams of research: theory and measurement. To this end, I have a) developed a conceptual Process Model of User Engagement and tested/refined it in different computer-mediated environments, and b) created and evaluated the reliability and validity of a 31-item experiential questionnaire, the User Engagement Scale (UES) to measure user engagement with technology (available http://hdl.handle.net/2429/38783). The UES has been adapted by 50+ international research teams who have used it to examine UE with educational technologies, search systems, haptic technologies, health and consumer applications, and other media. In addition, researchers from the following organizations have contacted me to use the UES: Audible.com; US Army RDECOM ARL HRED Advanced Training \& Simulation Division (ATSD); Bell Labs Ireland; Space Human Factors Engineering, Lockheed Martin / NASA Johnson Space Center; User Experience Research AT\&T; Wired@Heart." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_3XBZHQVV/1}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:938})
\par
"Collectively, this work has led to productive collaborations with academic and industry researchers. Since 2008, my research program has generated 1 authored and 1 edited book; 11 published referred journal articles, 2 accepted and 2 in progress, 36 published referred conference full, poster and panel papers, 5 book chapters and 2 in progress, as well as several invited presentations. Emerging research is focusing on antecedents and outcomes of user engagement in exploratory search contents. I am exploring the ways in which user characteristics, design features, and content predict or facilitate engaging exploratory search experiences; I am also examining the personal and social outcomes of UE in this context, namely learning. This work will inform the design of exploratory search systems and contribute further to the understanding and measurement of user experience."

"Doctoral Dissertation:  Defining and Measuring Engagement in User Experiences with Technology" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_3XBZHQVV/1}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:938})
\par
"Research and Scholarship My research explores user engagement (UE) with technology.  Specifically, I investigate the conceptual nature of UE (What is it? What attributes of individuals, systems, and contexts facilitate or detract from engagement?), and how to measure it in the context of computer mediated environments. Over the past several years I have focused on two streams of research: theory and measurement.  To this end, I have a) developed a conceptual Process Model of User Engagement and tested/refined it in different computer-mediated environments, and b) created and evaluated the reliability and validity of a 31-item experiential questionnaire, the User Engagement Scale (UES) to measure user engagement with technology (available http://hdl.handle.net/2429/38783). The UES has been adapted by 50+ international research teams who have used it to examine UE with educational technologies, search systems, haptic technologies, health and consumer applications, and other media. In addition, researchers from the following organizations have contacted me to use the UES: Audible.com; US Army RDECOM ARL HRED Advanced Training \& Simulation Division (ATSD); Bell Labs Ireland; Space Human Factors Engineering, Lockheed Martin / NASA Johnson Space Center; User Experience Research AT\&T; Wired@Heart."

"Collectively, this work has led to productive collaborations with academic and industry researchers.  Since 2008, my research program has generated 1 authored and 1 edited book; 11 published referred journal articles, 2 accepted and 2 in progress, 36 published referred conference full, poster and panel papers, 5 book chapters and 2 in progress, as well as several invited presentations. Emerging research is focusing on antecedents and outcomes of user engagement in exploratory search contents. I am exploring the ways in which user characteristics, design features, and content predict or facilitate engaging exploratory search experiences; I am also examining the personal and social outcomes of UE in this context, namely learning. This work will inform the design of exploratory search systems and contribute further to the understanding and measurement of user experience."

"Play has been associated with increased frequency and satisfaction of system use (Atkinson \& Kydd), and has been attributed to increased motivation, challenge, and affect (Woszczynski et al., 2002). Thus elements of play are intrinsic to engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})
\par
"While information interaction focuses on the user experience with content, engagement is an expression of that interactivity. While some of the other frameworks stress the meaningfulness of the experience (i.e., aesthetics and flow), an engaging experience may make a lasting impression but have no more meaning than that the experience was enjoyable or challenging."

"Based on our exploration of these four theoretical frameworks and previous research on engagement, an understanding of engagement emerges. Like flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction, engagement builds upon the foundation of a usable system that is effective, efficient, and satisfying. The theoretical framework that informs engagement integrates system attributes (i.e., feedback, challenge, sensory appeal) with the affective propensities of the user. Thus engagement is conceptually a holistic framework for understanding the integration of user and system variables, and how they combine to push the boundaries of user experience from merely perfunctory to pleasurable and memorable" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/6}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:943})
\par
"Application Areas We chose to explore engagement in four application areas: online shopping, Web searching, educational Webcasting, and video games. Our rationale for this was that studies of engagement exist predominantly in education and video games, while there is sparse research about engagement in online shopping and Web searching. By looking at these four applications, we intended to confirm past findings in the areas of video gaming and education applications, and to see what the areas of Web searching and online shopping would contribute to the understanding of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/6}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:943})
\par
"Education researchers have emphasized that engagement should be a pleasurable experience that involves intellectual challenge or stimulation (Douglas \& Hargadon, 2000; Read, MacFarlane, \& Casey, 2002). Read, MacFarlane, and Casey observed children's facial expressions to identify instances of engagement and fun, and linked remembering enjoyable situations and intending to perform them again. In addition to fun, researchers have explored the impact of specific technologies, including educational multimedia (Jacques et al., 1995), presentation software (Webster \& Ho," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/6}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:943})

\emph{Education researchers have emphasized that engagement should be a pleasurable\\
experience that involves intellectual challenge or stimulation (Douglas \& Hargadon,\\
2000; Read, MacFarlane, \& Casey, 2002). Read, MacFarlane, and Casey observed\\
children's facial expressions to identify instances of engagement and fun, and linked\\
remembering enjoyable situations and intending to perform them again. In addition to\\
fun, researchers have explored the impact of specific technologies, including\\
educational multimedia (Jacques et al., 1995), presentation software (Webster \& Ho,6\\
1997), computer-based versus video-based training applications (Chapman et al.,\\
1999), and film and hypertext (Laarni, Ravaja, Kallinen, \& Saari, 2004) on engagement.\\
The characteristics of engaging systems that emerge from these studies have included\\
ease of use, aesthetic appeal, and choice (Jacques et al.); feedback, challenge, and\\
variety (Webster \& Ho); interactivity (Chapman et al.; Laarni et al.); and sensory appeal\\
through the use of different multimedia components including text, graphics, and sound\\
(Laarni, et al.).\\
A number of these same attributes (e.g., feedback, intrinsic motivation, fun, user control,\\
and interactivity) have been studied in video games (Carroll \& Thomas, 1988; Vorderer,\\
Hartmann, \& Klimmt, 2003; Choi \& Kim, 2004). Said (2004) varied the amount of control\\
participants had over a video game, i.e., some children took on the role of characters,\\
some manipulated the characters' world, and others watched the game unfold without\\
being able to intervene. Results indicated that immediate feedback from the system,\\
well-defined goals, prior experience, and increasing challenge in proportion to gameplaying skills were essential attributes of engagement. Physiological arousal (Ravaja et\\
al., 2004), as well as players' sense of social presence (Champion, 2003) and sensation\\
seeking (Ravaja et al.), were all factors of engagement with video games (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/6}{note on p.943})}
\par
"Engagement has rarely been examined in online shopping and search applications. However, given the role of affect in both of these contexts (see, e.g., Nahl \& Bilal, 2007; Arnold \& Reynolds, 2003), we can extrapolate that engagement in these areas will be not only purposeful but pleasurable, and that this emotional component will make people more likely to return to a specific product or company Web site (Webster \& Ahuja, 2004). Qualities of Web sites, such as novelty (Toms, 1998; 2000) and aesthetics (Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004; Skelly et al., 1994), as well as feedback, navigability, control, and interactivity (Huang, 2003), have demonstrated that users' needs for both information and entertainment must be satisfied when it comes to engaging searching and shopping experiences. Poor Web site design and usability may Web searching is hampered by a Web site's poor navigational structure, users are left feeling disoriented and frustrated (Atkinson \& Kydd, 1997; Webster \& Ahuja, 2004), and that they lack control over the interaction (Rozell \& Gardner, 2000)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/7}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:944})
\par
"Table 2 summarizes the attributes of engagement that emerge from reviewing research in the areas of education, video games, online shopping, and searching.

The characteristics of engaging systems that emerge from these studies have included ease of use, aesthetic appeal, and choice (Jacques et al.); feedback, challenge, and variety (Webster \& Ho); interactivity (Chapman et al.; Laarni et al.); and sensory appeal through the use of different multimedia components including text, graphics, and sound (Laarni, et al.). A number of these same attributes (e.g., feedback, intrinsic motivation, fun, user control, and interactivity) have been studied in video games (Carroll \& Thomas, 1988; Vorderer, Hartmann, \& Klimmt, 2003; Choi \& Kim, 2004). Said (2004) varied the amount of control participants had over a video game, i.e., some children took on the role of characters, some manipulated the characters' world, and others watched the game unfold without being able to intervene. Results indicated that immediate feedback from the system, well-defined goals, prior experience, and increasing challenge in proportion to gameplaying skills were essential attributes of engagement. Physiological arousal (Ravaja et al., 2004), as well as players' sense of social presence (Champion, 2003) and sensation seeking (Ravaja et al.), were all factors of engagement with video games" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/7}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:944})

"RESEARCH DESIGN Based on our synthesis of aesthetic, flow, play, and information interaction theories, and on previous work in the application areas of video games, online shopping, Web searching, and educational software, we propose a definition of engagement: Engagement is a category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. As a result, the research question that guided the design of this study is: Is this definition of engagement complete? In other words, has previous research identified all of the possible attributes of engagement, or are there others that have yet to be recognized?"

"METHODOLOGY There are a variety of methods that we might have employed to study this construct, including surveys, participant observation, and so forth. However, due to the exploratory nature of our research, we could not be confident in creating questionnaire items or classifying observed behaviors. Nor could we be certain that studying this phenomenon while participants were actively engaged would not interfere with their experiences. In addition, it was our belief that there is more to engagement than we could garner by studying the activity itself. We concluded that conducting semistructured interviews was the best method, because it enabled us to delve into the thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of our participants and to allow them to recount a real-life experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/9}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:946})

"A drawback to this methodology is that Wright, 2004), a conclusion reached by Ericsson and Simon (1993) in their analysis of retrospective verbal protocols. As such, it may be biased by users' reflections of events as they relate to other experiences; some details may be withheld or changed since this method relies on accurate recall and depends on what participants deem important or memorable. On the other hand, if an experience was truly memorable, then participants likely remember the details of the experience. Ericsson and Simon further acknowledged that situations of intense cognitive activity, such as that required for the applications we were investigating, tend not to produce useful data when done concurrently with real-time data collection in the form of think-alouds. Given the methodological research in this area, the method we chose was the best given this set of circumstances. Thus, we acknowledge that our interview data is part recall and part interpretation on the part of our participants, but we believe that participants' reflections of their experiences communicate memorable information about the nature of their engagement."

"Based upon our conjecture that engagement is a quality of user experience, we used McCarthy and Wright's (2004) framework for interpreting our results. The four threads of experience are (a) compositional (i.e., beginning, middle, and end); (b) spatiotemporal (i.e., the subtasks being performed as part of participants' application use, such as searching, browsing, comparing information, and communicating with others, as well as their awareness of themselves and their environments, and characteristics of the technology); (c) emotional, (e.g., pleasure, fatigue); (d) sensual (i.e., cognitive [e.g., problem solving], and behavioral [e.g., interactivity] components of the experience). The interview was designed to elicit participants' reactions to each of these components of experience. Specifically we asked them to recount their affective responses, sensory impressions of their environments and the interface, and perceptions of how much time they spent on the computer-based activity. In accordance with the compositional thread, we allowed our participants to tell us a story" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/10}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:947})

"In summary, the period of sustained engagement was marked by participants' attention and interest being maintained in the interaction.

"Thus reengagement with these applications occurred in both the shortand long-term. Participants reengaged if the system disengaged them before they were truly ready. They also reengaged after they had abandoned their tasks to see to personal needs, take time to consider and compare information, or switch tasks. Returning to an application in future was the result of positive past experience with that application. These motivations were about having fun, being rewarded with convenience and incentives, and learning or discovering something new" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/17}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:954})

\emph{A PROPOSED MODEL OF ENGAGEMENT\\
The outcome of this exploratory study is the identification of four distinct stages of\\
engagement and the attributes that characterize each stage. The point of engagement\\
is initiated by the aesthetic appeal or novel presentation of the interface, the users'\\
motivations and interests, and users' ability and desire to be situated in the interaction\\
and to perceive that there is sufficient time to use the application. Engagement is21\\
sustained when users are able to maintain their attention and interest in the application,\\
and is characterized by positive emotions. Users want to customize the interface to\\
meet their needs and receive appropriate and timely feedback from the application. In\\
addition, they want to lose their perception of time and others during some interactions,\\
but keep their awareness of others in cases where engagement is enhanced by social\\
interaction. Users disengage for many reasons such as the usability of the technology\\
(i.e., challenge and interactivity), and distractions in their environments. This stage,\\
depending on the outcome, resulted in either positive or negative emotions. Figure 1\\
illustrates the model (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/21}{note on p.958})}

\par
"a single session contains a range of engaging experiences that vary in intensity. Users may be engaged or not engaged, but engagement itself operates on a continuum. In this way it is similar to the construct of usability in that it may be poor, average, or high. The point of engagement may occur at any point during the interaction when users delve beyond the mechanistic or routine level (Norman, Ortony, \& Russel, 2003) and invest themselves in the interaction. We propose that, at this stage, the interface must present information in a novel or aesthetically pleasing way in order to capture users' motivation and interest and situate them in the interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})
\par
"Our research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained. Users must be made to feel part of the interaction through an awareness of what the system is doing (feedback) and feeling connected to the technology (interactivity) or to other people (social awareness), and in control over what is happening. The richness of the application generates positive emotions in users. A representation of attributes during this stage is depicted in Figure 1 to convey the dynamic interaction that is taking place during this period. The intensity of these attributes may vary depending on the users' expectations of and experience with the technology, the type of interaction, and the nature of the technology itself."

"engagement has not been explicitly identified as a process. Chapman (1997) examined which may equate with our point of engagement stage but most researchers have not articulated engagement as having a beginning, middle, and end, nor what attributes might characterize each of these stages. The idea of reengagement that may occur during the same session with an application or at a future time is novel. The second contribution of this model is that we have linked attributes of engagement to each stage of the process. We have considered all of the disparate engagement attributes, and we have identified which attributes are most significant to particular stages of the engagement process."

"Previous work suggested that challenge, pleasure, endurability, attention, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, variety/novelty, interest, interactivity, and perceived user control were attributes of engagement. We confirmed the presence of these attributes in the engagement process. In addition, we discovered that awareness of others and one's environment, and perception of time, were also part of engaging experiences. Thus, we have expanded our original definition of engagement to include these additional attributes: Engagement is a quality of user experiences with technology that is characterized by challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:961})

Chapman (1997) investigated engagement influences and outcomes, but his results are limited to a specific educational software package and user group. In addition, he concluded that some of the measurement items could have been improved in order to ensure that they measured what they were intended to (p. 123). In addition, both Kappelman (1995) and Chapman (1997) look at dimensions of engagement (i.e., product versus task, influences versus outcomes), but they do not define engagement as a process with a beginning, middle, and end, or state that there is an iterative component to engagement."

"Goal setting was put forward by Said (2004) as an untapped variable to consider for engagement.

"Like Said (2004), we found behavioral and cognitive manifestations of engagement during this phase, as demonstrated in users' appraisals of the challenge, novelty, and control afforded to them by the system, and their actions, mediated by the system's ability to provide feedback and customization options. However, we also saw the role of affect in positive and negative emotions, a finding similar to Kappelman (1995), who identified attitude as a major component of his product/process matrix of system involvement.

"Although Webster and Ho (1997) found evidence for higher levels of engagement with more interactive applications, the amount of interactivity was not indicative of engagement in this study. Rather, it was the quality and appropriateness of the interactivity to the user's task that precipitated engagement. This is supported by Jacques et al. (1995), who found that students' preferences for visualor text-based educational multimedia depended on the task they needed to perform, and by Skelly et al.

\par
"ABSTRACT The purpose of this article is to critically deconstruct the term engagement as it applies to peoples' experiences with technology. Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user-system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement a term not defined consistently in past work as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences."

Just as we have worked to identify users' perceptions, actions, and attitudes about how to make a system functional and intuitive to use, we must concentrate on understanding how to make systems more engaging. Given the increased emphasis on user experience, it is no longer sufficient to ensure that a system is merely usable (Blythe, Overbeeke, Monk, \& Wright, 2003)."

Jacques et al. (1995) looked at a limited number of cognitive and affective variables in relation to the format and display of a specific multimedia system. Said's approach was based on children's interactions with video games, and Chapman's research examined university students' reactions to presentation software.

"The exception to this is Chapman and colleagues (Chapman, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999) who related engagement to flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). In addition to flow theory, other theories emerged from our analysis of previous research of user experiences in humancomputer interaction: aesthetic theory (Beardsley, 1982) play theory (Stephenson, 1967), and information interaction (Toms, 2002). We examine all of these theories flow, play, aesthetics, and information interaction to inform our understanding of user experiences. seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great mihalyi, 1990, p. 4). Flow theory has been used to explore situational and personality variables associated with computer-based tasks (Woszczynski, Roth, \& Segars, 2002), to predict and design for flow experiences (Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), and to understand users' reactions to and motivations for using applications (Ghani \& Deshpande, 1994; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001). Engagement has that engagement may share some attributes with flow, such as focused attention, feedback, control, activity orientation (i.e., interactivity), and intrinsic motivation (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990). Previous studies indicate that engagement consists of system feedback, user control (Brown \& Cairns, 2004), attention, motivation (Chapman, 1997), and the ability of the system to challenge individuals at levels appropriate to their knowledge and skills (Skelly, Fries, Linnett, Nass, \& Reeves, 1994). Despite the common threads between engagement and flow, we propose that there are differences. Specifically, flow involves intrinsic motivation, yet engaging experiences may come about as well during the nonvoluntary use of a system. Further, flow requires sustained, long-term focus and loss of awareness of the outside world; engagement should still occur in the midst of today's multitasking and dynamic computer environments."

"Jennings (2000) suggested that aesthetic experiences are intrinsically motivating, require focused attention, stimulate curiosity, and are interesting and pleasurable. Some of these attributes, including interest, as well as aesthetics itself, have been associated with engagement (Chapman, 1997). Aesthetics is the visual appearance of the interface as it conforms to design principles (i.e., symmetry, balance, emphasis, harmony, proportion, rhythm, and unity; Beardsley, 1982). Aesthetic theory has been applied by software developers in interface design (Skelly et al., 1994; Lavie \& Tractinsky, 2004). Aesthetics has been linked to usability and users' skills and needs, as well as to the sensory aspects or format of the application (Laurel, 1993; Hummels, 2000, as cited in Overbeeke, Djajadiningrat, Hummels, Wensveen, \& Frens, 2003).

"Interaction pertains to the communication between the user and the computer interface (Schneiderman, 1997), where the interface is the medium enabling user experiences. The interface represents the union of information design (i.e., how data is categorized, presented, and made meaningful to the user), interaction design (i.e., how the information tells a story), and sensorial design (i.e., the techniques employed to stimulate and utilize the five senses; Shedroff, 1994). Information interaction is (Toms, 2002, p. 855 ). For the user, this sequence of events or activities occurs when people use systems (Wright, McCarthy, \& Meekison, 2003) and is contingent upon attributes of the user (e.g., motivations, expectations), system (e.g., usability), and contextual or environmental (e.g., organizational culture) characteri-stics (Hassenzahl \& Tractinsky, 2006), in addition to task (Marchionini, 1995) and content (Toms, 2002). Information interaction provides the connectivity for engagement. The computer system may be aesthetically appealing with design elements that promote play. The user may be susceptible to the state of flow. However, it is the interaction between users and systems operating within a specific context that facilitates an engaging experience."

\par
"Table 1 maps the characteristics that emerge from the literature for flow, aesthetics, play, and information interaction theories. In the final column, we hypothesize which of these attributes may be intrinsic to engagement. Concurrent with these theories, an engaging experience is encouraged by the sensory appeal of the system and the level of feedback and challenge the user receives from the system. Engaged users are affectively involved, motivated, and perceive themselves to be in control over the interaction. However, there are other characteristics inherent in flow, play, aesthetic, and information interaction theories that are unlikely to be present in engagement. Engaging experiences have the attention of the user, but, unlike experiences in flow and aesthetic theories, do not require users to become so focused that they lose their awareness of physical reality. In contrast to flow and play, engagement may not be dependent on the user forming specific goals for the interaction. Users may use an application without any specific purpose or desirable outcome and have an engaging experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:942})

\par
"Our research suggests that once engaged, users' attention and interest must be maintained." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})
\par
"Previous frameworks of engagement have emphasized what users are doing and thinking (e.g., Said, 2004) or feeling (Kappelman, 1995). The first contribution of our model is that it is holistic and presents the behaviors, cognitions, and emotions of users in the context of content, design, and interactive features of the application." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/23}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:960})
\par
"The second contribution of this model is that we have linked attributes of engagement to each stage of the process." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:961})
\par
"We have considered all of the disparate engagement attributes, and we have identified which attributes are most significant to particular stages of the engagement process." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:961})
\par
"The research objectives of this study were to conceptually and operationally define engagement. We proposed that engaging systems extend beyond usability of the application. Using flow, aesthetic, play and information interaction theories as our foundation, we discovered that the attributes of engagement challenge, affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, perceived control, and interactivity are products of the user-system interaction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:961})
\par
"In the midst of conceptually and operationally defining engagement, we have articulated a process model of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:961})
\par
"early delineated a systematic process that depicts engaging experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/24}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:961})

"is a strong predictor of systems success (DeLone \& McLean, 1992), and likely of whether systems are engaging" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/26}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:963})
\par
"Attributes of engagement. Central to this research was identifying the attributes of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/26}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:963})
\par
"Wells and Matthews (1994) state that attention may be based on the cognitive judgements people make about the relevance of specific stimuli to themselves or their tasks. This was the case with our participants who attended to interface features that would enable them to efficiently complete a task or to content on the interface that resonated with their personal interests." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"velty played an important role in this study in sustaining users' engagements with the applications. For video gamers, this took the form of unexpected auditory or visual stimuli (Aboulafia \& Bannon, 2004); shoppers were interested in seeing new products, and webcast viewers and Web searchers sought new content. However, there was a ceiling for novelty (Webster \& Ho, 1997), because participants did not wish for so much" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"attributes of engagement identified in this study" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"However, it is apparent that the attributes of engagement identified in this study interest, motivation, affect, attention, challenge, feedback, aesthetics and sensory appeal, awareness, novelty, perceived control, perceived time, and interactivity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"are products of the user-system interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"This demonstrates that usability is intricately woven into the experience of engagement;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/27}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:964})
\par
"Limitations The current findings are based on a selected sample of individuals at a specific point in time. As in most exploratory research, we cannot make absolute conclusions. However, the findings are, for the most part, in accordance with previous literature, leading one to speculate about the potential for generalizatio" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})
\par
"For example, video gamers seemed to have more difficulty disengaging than users of other applications, and were more likely to want more challenging experiences. One area of future research is examining the model more systematically within each of the application domains. Potentially, for example, the intensity of an attribute may vary with the application" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})
\par
"One of the major gaps in the literature on engagement is in empirical evidence about how it should be measured (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). Thus far attempts have been incomplete, nongeneralizable, or one-dimensional." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})
\par
"Our future goals are to develop and rigorously test an instrument to assess users' perceived engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})
\par
"This will provide a holistic view of engagement that encompasses all of the threads of user experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})
\par
"This research provides insights into the phenomenon of engagement and is a foundation for further research. We have confirmed and expounded a conceptual model that views engagement as a process in which computer users initiate and sustain engagement, disengage with the application or task, and potentially reengage several times during a single interaction with an application. The process is defined by the presence of multiple attributes that vary in intensity depending on a combination of user and system attributes that emerge during the interaction." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})

"We have put forward a model" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_UBRW6F4Q/28}{O'Brien and Toms 2008:965})

\emph{We have put forward a model\\
27that defines which attributes of engagement are most prominent during each phase in the process. We have highlighted attributes including attention, aesthetics, interest, challenge, control, motivation, novelty, and feedback as the user, system, and interaction components of the compositional, emotional, sensual, and spatiotemporal aspects of users' experience that predict and facilitate engagement. Our work has acknowledged the derivation of engagement from other constructs, such as flow, aesthetic experience, play, and information interaction and concluded that, while it shares attributes with these other frameworks, its combination and expression of components is unique. We have also demonstrated that engagement is consistent across different types of applications in terms of the attributes present and the trajectory followed by users through the process.

To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the composition of this construct and how to evaluate it. Building on previous work that posited a theory of engagement and identified a core set of attributes that operationalized this construct, we constructed and evaluated a multidimensional scale to measure user engagement. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, as well as two large-scale studies (N=440 and N=802) that were undertaken to assess its reliability and validity in online shopping environments. In the first we used Reliability Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify six attributes of engagement: Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Felt Involvement, Novelty, and Endurability. In the second we tested the validity of and relationships among those attributes using Structural Equation Modeling. The result of this research is a multidimensional scale that may be used to test the engagement of software applications. In addition, findings indicate that attributes of engagement are highly intertwined, a complex interplay of user-system interaction variables. Notably, Perceived Usability played a mediating role in the relationship between Endurability and Novelty, Aesthetics, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention.},

"Designing for engaging experiences is an oft-cited goal of interactive system development in many disciplines, yet there are no guidelines to channel designers' efforts to \rule{1em}{1pt}make things engaging{$\Vert$} (Overbeeke et al., 2003). Part of the issue has been that, until recently, there have been disparate ideas about what constitutes engagement. Without a consistent definition of engagement, it is difficult to ascertain that the systems we design and market are, in fact, engaging, or to identify what aspects of the interaction with technology engage or fail to engage users. Without a means of measuring engagement, we are limited in our understanding of this quality of user experience and our evaluations of user-centered technologies."

"O'Brien \& Toms (2008) drew together the threads of multiple research projects to identify the core attributes that constitute engaging experiences, and to propose a conceptual, process-based model of engagement that was founded on Aesthetic, Flow, and Play Theories. This" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:51})
\par
"Until recently, engagement was articulated loosely as a cognitive (Laurel, 1993), affective (specifically intrinsic motivation) (Jacques, 1996; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Jones, n.d.), and behavioral (Kappelman, 1995; Hutchins, Holland, \& Norman, 1986) state of interaction with a computer application that \rule{1em}{1pt}makes the [user] want to be there{$\Vert$} (Jones, n.d.). Engaging interactions were thought to involve attention (Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), intrinsic interest (Jacques, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), interactivity (Quesenbury, 2003), perceived control and choice (Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997), functionality (Jacques et al., 1995), and motivation ( Makkonen, 1997). This collection of attributes was derived from studies carried out in multiple disciplines (i.e., education, e-commerce, human-computer interaction, etc.) with varied applications, including educational multimedia (Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999) and presentation software (Webster \& Ho, 1997), print and online reading (Schraw, Flowerday, \& Reisetter, 1998; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001), museum exhibits (Haywood \& Cairns, 2005; Hull \& Reid, 2003), and video games (Reiber, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Overall, the model hypothesized that engagement is both a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users' needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury, 2003)."

"Measuring Engagement It has been stated that there is sparse empirical research about how engagement should be measured (Chapman, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). However, over the past 15 years a number of researchers have purported to measure engagement using a variety of data collection techniques. The most common of these has been self-report measures, including Webster and Ho's (1997) seven-item questionnaire with items pertaining to attention, challenge, intrinsic interest, and variety, and Jacques' (1996) 13- item survey containing items that related to attention, perceived time, motivation, needs, control, attitudes, and overall engagement. Some researchers have used performance indicators, not as measures of engagement, but as correlates of engagement. For example, Konradt and Sultz (2001) employed preand post-task measures to examine changes in users' affective and cognitive states over the course of interacting with an educational application. Chapman (1997) studied the relationship between engagement (as measured by Webster and Ho's instrument) and performance metrics, such as time on task (as gathered through log files) and knowledge of system content (as measured by multiple-choice quizzes) as a consequence of media format. One researcher posited that multiple measures (selfreport, participant observation, biometrics) are needed to study engagement but did not offer any results of empirical data collection or describe how these measures might be triangulated to say something meaningful about engagement (Champion, 2003). Performance indicators and physiological metrics have the advantage of being observed in users' biology (e.g., heart rate) or behaviors (e.g., eye gaze, mouse clicks) and collected over the course of an interaction with a system. Yet while metrics such as log analysis, number of eye fixations, heart rate, etc., answer the question of what is taking place during a user's interaction with a system, they do not address the users' cognitive or emotional state, both of which are critical to engagement. For example, Seah and Cairns (2008) found that conducting their study of immersion in video games in an experimental setting resulted in confounds they attributed to gamers' strong preferences for particular games. In addition, we do not have the ability to connect these metrics to engagement at this point in time. For instance, is a user \rule{1em}{1pt}engaged{$\Vert$} when they spend a great deal of time on a single screen of an application, or simply confused about how to navigate away from it? Increased attention, as measured through eye tracking, may signal heightened engagement, but focused attention may be one of many components of engagement, and thus this would give us an incomplete assessment. Furthermore, collecting physiological data may be obtrusive for some participants and interfere with the experience. Self-report measures are not as objective as performance and physiological measures, but they do offer a convenient and efficient means of assessing the users' perspective of an experience. As stated, a variety of researchers have developed survey instruments to evaluate engagement (e.g., Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques, 1996), but these have not been generalized to domains beyond the ones in which they were created and administered. In addition, the items contained in each of these instruments 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:54})
\par
"represent a small portion of the attributes of engagement found in our exploratory study (see O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). Existing measures of usability (e.g., The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction: http://www.lap.umd.edu/QUIS/index.html; The System Usability Questionnaire, Brooke, 1996) address the functionality of systems and users' satisfaction in using them, but do not tap into more experiential aspects of use, such as one's interest and motivation to use the application or continue using it, or the visual appearance of the interface, etc. Given the demands of today's technology users, it is essential to develop an instrument that encapsulates more than usability." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/6}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:55})
\par
"As in prior research, we believe that a survey instrument is the most appropriate technique for collecting users' perception of their level of engagement. Unlike prior research our earlier work strongly suggested that engagement was more broadly defined. As a result, we elected to build a scale that encompassed significantly more attributes than previous instruments. Such a scale would serve an added purpose: it could validate or refine the attributes identified in the earlier exploratory study. From a practical viewpoint, we envisioned that the resulting instrument would be an effective tool for comparing technologies (e.g., Website X and Website Y), collecting feedback during the design process of an application, or assessing users' responses to an existing system. The instrument would not only provide an overall evaluation of the user's experience, but would convey users' perceptions of the attributes."

"Novelty. Pace (2004) suggested that novelty in online content has the potential to sustain users' attention, specifically when novelty is introduced through links and content that are pertinent to users' goals. Pace emphasized the \rule{1em}{1pt}congruence{$\Vert$} between interest, novelty, and searchers' goals in directed attention. This is concurrent with the view that there is an \rule{1em}{1pt}optimal level{$\Vert$} of arousal; diverging from this level may have negative consequences for users' experiences (Hebb, 1972). The relationship between novelty and focused attention may be approached from the state-trait curiosity model (Boyle, 1983). Boyle stated that external and internal stimuli, as well as individual differences, combine to form a cognitive appraisal of a situation, which results in behavior."

"Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. In this work, the Focused Attention factor is defined by items pertaining to focused attention, awareness, and perceptions of time. These facets represent some, though not all, characteristics of Flow. Since prior research explored Flow and aspects of usability 21" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/21}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:70})
\par
"(e.g., Pace, 2004), this is a useful starting point for examining the relationship between Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. Pace (2004) found that the match between perceived challenge and searchers' skill was directly related to participants' ability to achieve a state of flow. Furthermore, Pace found that poor system usability, exemplified by lengthy response times, disorganized content, inconsistent navigation cues, cluttered page layout, etc., may interrupt flow by directing users' attention away from the salient aspects of the experience. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"Felt Involvement and Perceived Usability. The Felt Involvement factor contained items about how much fun users' were having during the interaction and how drawn in they were able to become. Mathwick and Ridgon (2004) found that the quality of users' interactions depended on the degree of challenge presented by an online search task, the skills they possessed to meet those challenges, and their perceptions of control over the interaction. Pace (2004) stated that poor usability could impede users' enjoyment. Based on this, it would seem that Perceived Usability would predict Felt Involvement. However, our instrument measures postexperience Perceived Usability. Therefore, if the user has experienced Felt Involvement, it is because the usability of the system did not interrupt or prevent them from enjoying themselves; in this situation, judgments of the Perceived Usability will be influenced by the level of involvement achieved. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"Endurability. Endurability is the assessment of users' perception of success with a task, and their willingness to use an application in future or recommend it to others. The Endurability factor is really the summation of the experience and is therefore positioned as the outcome variable in the model. Users' evaluations of the Aesthetics and Novelty of an application will influence their degree of Focused Attention and Felt Involvement, and subsequently their Perceived Usability of the system. All of these factors will predict users' lasting impressions of the experience and their willingness to engage with the application at another point in time.

Although constructs such as flow (e.g., Webster, Trevino, \& Ryan, 1993; Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), play (Mathwick \& Rigdon, 2004), and interactivity (Liu, 2003) have been studied in these contexts, engagement has not.

Given the obtrusiveness of biometrics, and the fact that conducting usability, physiological, and eye tracking studies can be involved and require special, costly equipment, demonstrating the criterion validity of the scale may offer the design and research communities a more cost-effective, quick, and accessible means of evaluating user engagement with technologies and be used in various stages of interface design. Another aspect of future work is to address its relationship with other scales (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model, Cognitive Absorption, etc.) in order to ascertain whether the Engagement Scale correlates with other measures. This will enable us to examine theoretical/empirical redundancies and differences (Clark \& Watson, 1995) between the Engagement Scale and other metrics."

"demonstrating that there is a need during the design process to consider \rule{1em}{1pt}the whole user experience{$\Vert$} rather than \rule{1em}{1pt}a single dimension{$\Vert$} (Quesenbury, 2003, p. 89). These results also have implications for evaluating the holistic nature of user experience. In the past, aesthetics, novelty, usability, etc., have typically been examined in isolation or in select sets. For example, Tractinsky (1997; Tractinsky, Katz, \& Ikar, 2000), as well as Shenkman \& Jonsson (2000), brought awareness to how the aesthetic qualities of interfaces influenced users' judgments of the usability and the selection of information content. We postulate that multiple factors of experience must be examined concurrently and are related to each other, and conclude that engagement, a quality of users experience with technology, is a multidimensional construct. Moving beyond measurement, the co-presence of multiple factors during experience will, in future, influence design guidelines. The survey instrument itself is a brief, easily administered, and statistically verified tool that may be used by software designers to assess their applications or by researchers for academic purposes. For example, one could use it to determine users' ratings of a Website's aesthetics or novelty. The instrument was derived from the concepts of actual users and previous metrics and, as a result, is more comprehensive than previous measures and expands the scope of how engagement has been characterized in the past. It consolidates disparate attributes (i.e., attention, challenge, curiosity, intrinsic interest, and control) (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999); curiosity, feedback, and challenge (Skelley et al., 1994), aesthetics (Chapman, 1997), and interaction, system format, and the presentation of the content (Jacques et al., 1995) into six factors that encompass the complex interaction between people and technology. The scale is a window into users' appraisals of the application and these perceptions are highly valuable in a marketplace, where there is a high degree of competition for users' time, interest, and money. Yet, its importance goes beyond the marketing of technology and into the fundamentals of what we are designing for and measuring in our work to enhance users' interactions with technology. The next wave of research is shifting beyond human-computer interaction to humancomputer experience; this represents the holistic and diverse relationships that people have with technology encountered in daily life. The scope of user experience\textemdash what one could be designing for and measuring\textemdash is broad. This work is a foundation upon which we can build a dialog about engagement, perform further testing of the model and scale, and examine additional methods for measuring the attributes and their relationships" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/33}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:82})

"Designing for engaging experiences is an oft-cited goal of interactive system development in many disciplines, yet there are no guidelines to channel designers' efforts to \rule{1em}{1pt}make things engaging{$\Vert$} (Overbeeke et al., 2003). Part of the issue has been that, until recently, there have been disparate ideas about what constitutes engagement. Without a consistent definition of engagement, it is difficult to ascertain that the systems we design and market are, in fact, engaging, or to identify what aspects of the interaction with technology engage or fail to engage users. Without a means of measuring engagement, we are limited in our understanding of this quality of user experience and our evaluations of user-centered technologies."

\par
"Until recently, engagement was articulated loosely as a cognitive (Laurel, 1993), affective (specifically intrinsic motivation) (Jacques, 1996; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Jones, n.d.), and behavioral (Kappelman, 1995; Hutchins, Holland, \& Norman, 1986) state of interaction with a computer application that \rule{1em}{1pt}makes the [user] want to be there{$\Vert$} (Jones, n.d.). Engaging interactions were thought to involve attention (Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), intrinsic interest (Jacques, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), interactivity (Quesenbury, 2003), perceived control and choice (Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997), functionality (Jacques et al., 1995), and motivation ( Makkonen, 1997). This collection of attributes was derived from studies carried out in multiple disciplines (i.e., education, e-commerce, human-computer interaction, etc.) with varied applications, including educational multimedia (Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999) and presentation software (Webster \& Ho, 1997), print and online reading (Schraw, Flowerday, \& Reisetter, 1998; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001), museum exhibits (Haywood \& Cairns, 2005; Hull \& Reid, 2003), and video games (Reiber, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Overall, the model hypothesized that engagement is both a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users' needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury, 2003)."

"Measuring Engagement It has been stated that there is sparse empirical research about how engagement should be measured (Chapman, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). However, over the past 15 years a number of researchers have purported to measure engagement using a variety of data collection techniques. The most common of these has been self-report measures, including Webster and Ho's (1997) seven-item questionnaire with items pertaining to attention, challenge, intrinsic interest, and variety, and Jacques' (1996) 13- item survey containing items that related to attention, perceived time, motivation, needs, control, attitudes, and overall engagement. Some researchers have used performance indicators, not as measures of engagement, but as correlates of engagement. For example, Konradt and Sultz (2001) employed preand post-task measures to examine changes in users' affective and cognitive states over the course of interacting with an educational application. Chapman (1997) studied the relationship between engagement (as measured by Webster and Ho's instrument) and performance metrics, such as time on task (as gathered through log files) and knowledge of system content (as measured by multiple-choice quizzes) as a consequence of media format. One researcher posited that multiple measures (selfreport, participant observation, biometrics) are needed to study engagement but did not offer any results of empirical data collection or describe how these measures might be triangulated to say something meaningful about engagement (Champion, 2003). Performance indicators and physiological metrics have the advantage of being observed in users' biology (e.g., heart rate) or behaviors (e.g., eye gaze, mouse clicks) and collected over the course of an interaction with a system. Yet while metrics such as log analysis, number of eye fixations, heart rate, etc., answer the question of what is taking place during a user's interaction with a system, they do not address the users' cognitive or emotional state, both of which are critical to engagement. For example, Seah and Cairns (2008) found that conducting their study of immersion in video games in an experimental setting resulted in confounds they attributed to gamers' strong preferences for particular games. In addition, we do not have the ability to connect these metrics to engagement at this point in time. For instance, is a user \rule{1em}{1pt}engaged{$\Vert$} when they spend a great deal of time on a single screen of an application, or simply confused about how to navigate away from it? Increased attention, as measured through eye tracking, may signal heightened engagement, but focused attention may be one of many components of engagement, and thus this would give us an incomplete assessment. Furthermore, collecting physiological data may be obtrusive for some participants and interfere with the experience. Self-report measures are not as objective as performance and physiological measures, but they do offer a convenient and efficient means of assessing the users' perspective of an experience. As stated, a variety of researchers have developed survey instruments to evaluate engagement (e.g., Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques, 1996), but these have not been generalized to domains beyond the ones in which they were created and administered. In addition, the items contained in each of these instruments 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:54})
\par
"represent a small portion of the attributes of engagement found in our exploratory study (see O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). Existing measures of usability (e.g., The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction: http://www.lap.umd.edu/QUIS/index.html; The System Usability Questionnaire, Brooke, 1996) address the functionality of systems and users' satisfaction in using them, but do not tap into more experiential aspects of use, such as one's interest and motivation to use the application or continue using it, or the visual appearance of the interface, etc. Given the demands of today's technology users, it is essential to develop an instrument that encapsulates more than usability."

\par
"As in prior research, we believe that a survey instrument is the most appropriate technique for collecting users' perception of their level of engagement. Unlike prior research our earlier work strongly suggested that engagement was more broadly defined. As a result, we elected to build a scale that encompassed significantly more attributes than previous instruments. Such a scale would serve an added purpose: it could validate or refine the attributes identified in the earlier exploratory study. From a practical viewpoint, we envisioned that the resulting instrument would be an effective tool for comparing technologies (e.g., Website X and Website Y), collecting feedback during the design process of an application, or assessing users' responses to an existing system. The instrument would not only provide an overall evaluation of the user's experience, but would convey users' perceptions of the attributes."

This is concurrent with the view that there is an \rule{1em}{1pt}optimal level{$\Vert$} of arousal; diverging from this level may have negative consequences for users' experiences (Hebb, 1972).

"(e.g., Pace, 2004), this is a useful starting point for examining the relationship between Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. Pace (2004) found that the match between perceived challenge and searchers' skill was directly related to participants' ability to achieve a state of flow. Furthermore, Pace found that poor system usability, exemplified by lengthy response times, disorganized content, inconsistent navigation cues, cluttered page layout, etc., may interrupt flow by directing users' attention away from the salient aspects of the experience.

"Felt Involvement and Perceived Usability. The Felt Involvement factor contained items about how much fun users' were having during the interaction and how drawn in they were able to become. Mathwick and Ridgon (2004) found that the quality of users' interactions depended on the degree of challenge presented by an online search task, the skills they possessed to meet those challenges, and their perceptions of control over the interaction. Pace (2004) stated that poor usability could impede users' enjoyment. Based on this, it would seem that Perceived Usability would predict Felt Involvement. However, our instrument measures postexperience Perceived Usability. Therefore, if the user has experienced Felt Involvement, it is because the usability of the system did not interrupt or prevent them from enjoying themselves; in this situation, judgments of the Perceived Usability will be influenced by the level of involvement achieved.

The Endurability factor is really the summation of the experience and is therefore positioned as the outcome variable in the model. Users' evaluations of the Aesthetics and Novelty of an application will influence their degree of Focused Attention and Felt Involvement, and subsequently their Perceived Usability of the system. All of these factors will predict users' lasting impressions of the experience and their willingness to engage with the application at another point in time. The final hypothesis is that" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})

"H6: Perceived Usability predicts Endurability From these predictions, a fully mediated model emerges where Perceived Usability mediates the relationship between the Endurability of the experience and the other four factors.

Given the obtrusiveness of biometrics, and the fact that conducting usability, physiological, and eye tracking studies can be involved and require special, costly equipment, demonstrating the criterion validity of the scale may offer the design and research communities a more cost-effective, quick, and accessible means of evaluating user engagement with technologies and be used in various stages of interface design. Another aspect of future work is to address its relationship with other scales (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model, Cognitive Absorption, etc.) in order to ascertain whether the Engagement Scale correlates with other measures. This will enable us to examine theoretical/empirical redundancies and differences (Clark \& Watson, 1995) between the Engagement Scale and other metrics."

These results also have implications for evaluating the holistic nature of user experience. In the past, aesthetics, novelty, usability, etc., have typically been examined in isolation or in select sets. For example, Tractinsky (1997; Tractinsky, Katz, \& Ikar, 2000), as well as Shenkman \& Jonsson (2000), brought awareness to how the aesthetic qualities of interfaces influenced users' judgments of the usability and the selection of information content.

The instrument was derived from the concepts of actual users and previous metrics and, as a result, is more comprehensive than previous measures and expands the scope of how engagement has been characterized in the past. It consolidates disparate attributes (i.e., attention, challenge, curiosity, intrinsic interest, and control) (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999); curiosity, feedback, and challenge (Skelley et al., 1994), aesthetics (Chapman, 1997), and interaction, system format, and the presentation of the content (Jacques et al., 1995) into six factors that encompass the complex interaction between people and technology. The scale is a window into users' appraisals of the application and these perceptions are highly valuable in a marketplace, where there is a high degree of competition for users' time, interest, and money. Yet, its importance goes beyond the marketing of technology and into the fundamentals of what we are designing for and measuring in our work to enhance users' interactions with technology. The next wave of research is shifting beyond human-computer interaction to humancomputer experience; this represents the holistic and diverse relationships that people have with technology encountered in daily life. The scope of user experience\textemdash what one could be designing for and measuring\textemdash is broad. This work is a foundation upon which we can build a dialog about engagement, perform further testing of the model and scale, and examine additional methods for measuring the attributes and their relationships" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/33}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:82})

"ABSTRACT This paper examines the validity of the User Engagement Scale (UES). Originally developed and tested in e-shopping, the scale was administered to users of a multimedia webcast system in an experimental setting. Factor analysis examined the structure and loadings of 31 items. As in previous research, a six-factor solution was found. However, the number of items was reduced and one of the original sub-scales (Felt Involvement) was eliminated. These results are examined contextually by comparing the current study with previous research. The findings discuss the feasibility of a universal measure of user engagement in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/2}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:51})

"Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) combines system-centered and human-centered approaches to investigate information seeking, retrieval and use [6] in dynamic contexts. As such, there are a variety of methods employed in the conduct of IIR studies, ranging from system-based precision and recall to more usercentered measures pertaining to users' thoughts and feelings while interacting with IIR systems. Users' perceptions of experience are challenging to quantify, since users themselves may have difficulty articulating their cognitive and affective responses to systems, and these reactions may not be readily observable to researchers. However, perceptual variables are essential components of IIR research. They may determine if users will use a system to learn, purchase a product, carry out research or work-related tasks, etc. in future, and they may influence users' performance with a system [1]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/2}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:51})
\par
"One type of measurement used to quantify and make sense of users' experience with IIR systems are psychometric scales." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/3}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:52})
\par
"There is a history of such instruments in the disciplines of psychology, education, and business to address, for instance, technology adoption in the workplace (Technology Acceptance Model) [3], and to make abstract constructs concrete through "a surrogate set of behaviorally relevant measures" [14]. Scales have been developed to explore users' interactions with technology. Some of these are focused on aspects of system usability, such as satisfaction [5] or disorientation in navigation [1], while others examine pleasurable states of interaction with systems, such as playfulness [15], flow [10], and engagement [8]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/3}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:52})
\par
"The User Engagement Scale (UES) [8] is a multidimensional scale that contains six sub-scales: Aesthetics, Novelty, Felt Involvement, Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, and Endurability. Its purpose is to assist researchers and designers of IIR systems in reaching a holistic understanding of users' encounters with technology, tapping into cognitive, affective and behavioural perceptions of interactions, and gauging future intentions to use a system. The scale seeks to simultaneously measure multiple aspects of engaging experiences and understand their relationships to one another" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/3}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:52})

\par
"In order for measurement scales to become established, practical tools in IIR research and system design, they must be reliable, valid, and generalizable. Reliability pertains to whether or not the items that make up the overall scale or its sub-scales demonstrate internal consistency [11]. The purpose of validity is to demonstrate the ability of an instrument to capture the phenomena of interest to the researcher. Of particular significance to the current study is external validity, or the pertinence of research findings to "the real world" [6]. Another associated term is generalizability, the "administrative viability and interpretation [of a scale] in different research situations" [11, p. 79-80], or the "larger universe" [13, p. 288]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/3}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:52})
\par
"As [6] points out, measures developed in the fields of human-computer interaction and information systems may not be plug-and-play in IIR studies. IIR encompasses differentdevices, domains, populations, tasks, settings, and numbers of simultaneous users. In the current study, data were collected to assess the external validity of the UES in a different context from the one in which it was originally developed and tested. An experimental set up, rather than an online survey, was the setting in which we examined participants' interactions with a webcast system. We evaluated the reliability of the sub-scales and the factor structure of the UES to explore its external validity." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/4}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:53})
\par
"METHOD The current study was designed to test users' engagement with and performance using a Webcast system (Figure 1). Webcasts contain multimedia content (video, audio, images, and text) and are used to broadcast presentations, meetings, and lectures, and record and archive them for later retrieval" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/4}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:53})
\par
"Procedure This was a between-subjects design where participants interacted with the Slide-based or Webcast interface. All participants followed the same experimental procedure: they completed a brief tutorial of the system they were randomly assigned to, and then performed two tasks (presented in counterbalanced order). Participants viewed two presentations, also counterbalanced to prevent order effects. One presentation was on the topic of management and comprised two lectures on leadership and health (total slides: 48; duration: 72 minutes). The other presentation pertained to folksonomies, and culture and heritage (total slides: 46; duration: 57 minutes). Participants completed demographic, two post-task, and a post-session questionnaire. The latter contained the UES with items rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/5}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:54})
\par
"Correlation Analysis An examination of the factor structure of the UES items began with correlation analysis of the items within each of the six sub-scales. As demonstrated in Table 2, most of the sub-scales were significantly correlated with correlation coefficients in the moderate range (0.23 to 0.63). However, the Perceived Usability (PU) showed negative relationships with Novelty (NO) and Focused Attention (FA), a low correlation with Felt Involvement (FI), and a significant relationship with Endurability (EN)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/6}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:55})
\par
"4.2.2 Factor Analysis Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis with oblique rotation [2] was used to examine the factorstructure of the UES. The guidelines for interpreting item loadings were derived from [15]. Items were discarded if they did not load with a minimum value of 3.2 (10\% overlapping variance) or crossloaded with a value of 3.2 on more than one factor. Over five iterations, 12 items were eliminated: 3 PU, 3 EN, 1 NO, 2 FA, and all 3 FI items. The result was six factors. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO = 0.72) and Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (x2=1042.6, df=171, p{$<$}0.001) were significant. The final factor analysis is displayed in Table 3. Cronbach's alpha values of the resulting factors are shown in row 2. Items are listed in column one; the label in brackets corresponds to the original results [8]. Factor 1 consisted of 5 AE items, while FA (5) items loaded on factor 2. The PU items loaded on two factors: 3 items pertaining to affective responses formed factor 3, while 2 challenge items loaded on factor 4. Factor 5 consisted of 2 NO items and factor 6 contained 2 EN items." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/6}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:55})
\par
"Users' interactions with IIR systems are "dynamic, complex, situated [and] temporally bound," and contingent upon the internal states of users [7]. Context is another area of interest when comparing the findings of the current study to previous results. The UES was developed and administered to online shoppers (70\% female) who ranged in age and occupation. They completed the scale based on experiences with online shopping in general (study 1) and with a specific retailer (study 2) [8]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/7}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:56})
\par
"The current study had a different demographic makeup: they were undergraduate university students (\textasciitilde{} 60\% male) under the age of 27. They completed the UES in the context of a lab experiment with researcher-generated tasks immediately following the interaction. Although participants may have had experience with video, slide, and timeline applications, the webcast system presented these media together in what was likely a novel app" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/8}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:57})
\par
"Given the diversity of IIR systems and users, should we conclude that the UES and psychometric instruments in general are not useful in IIR evaluation? In short, no. Measuring user perception is essential in IIR evaluation, and these tools give us parameters for gauging these perceptions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/8}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:57})
\par
"CONCLUSION This study tested the external validity of the UES in an experimental setting with users of a webcast system" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/8}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:57})
\par
"We also encourage further research in the area of measurement, specifically the reliability, validity, and generalizability of user perception metrics in IIR. It is imperative to rigorously evaluate our instruments as well as the data we collect. This will ensure confidence in our analysis of the relationships between measures and conclusions, and will establish a body of work that can be used to assess longitudinal trends and outcomes in IIR" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_TNCTMZEQ/8}{O'Brien-Toms 2010:57})

"Designing for engaging experiences is an oft-cited goal of interactive system development in many disciplines, yet there are no guidelines to channel designers' efforts to \rule{1em}{1pt}make things engaging{$\Vert$} (Overbeeke et al., 2003). Part of the issue has been that, until recently, there have been disparate ideas about what constitutes engagement. Without a consistent definition of engagement, it is difficult to ascertain that the systems we design and market are, in fact, engaging, or to identify what aspects of the interaction with technology engage or fail to engage users. Without a means of measuring engagement, we are limited in our understanding of this quality of user experience and our evaluations of user-centered technologies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:51})
\par
"Until recently, engagement was articulated loosely as a cognitive (Laurel, 1993), affective (specifically intrinsic motivation) (Jacques, 1996; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Jones, n.d.), and behavioral (Kappelman, 1995; Hutchins, Holland, \& Norman, 1986) state of interaction with a computer application that \rule{1em}{1pt}makes the [user] want to be there{$\Vert$} (Jones, n.d.). Engaging interactions were thought to involve attention (Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), intrinsic interest (Jacques, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), interactivity (Quesenbury, 2003), perceived control and choice (Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997), functionality (Jacques et al., 1995), and motivation ( Makkonen, 1997). This collection of attributes was derived from studies carried out in multiple disciplines (i.e., education, e-commerce, human-computer interaction, etc.) with varied applications, including educational multimedia (Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999) and presentation software (Webster \& Ho, 1997), print and online reading (Schraw, Flowerday, \& Reisetter, 1998; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001), museum exhibits (Haywood \& Cairns, 2005; Hull \& Reid, 2003), and video games (Reiber, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Overall, the model hypothesized that engagement is both a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users' needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury, 2003)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Measuring Engagement It has been stated that there is sparse empirical research about how engagement should be measured (Chapman, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). However, over the past 15 years a number of researchers have purported to measure engagement using a variety of data collection techniques. The most common of these has been self-report measures, including Webster and Ho's (1997) seven-item questionnaire with items pertaining to attention, challenge, intrinsic interest, and variety, and Jacques' (1996) 13- item survey containing items that related to attention, perceived time, motivation, needs, control, attitudes, and overall engagement. Some researchers have used performance indicators, not as measures of engagement, but as correlates of engagement. For example, Konradt and Sultz (2001) employed preand post-task measures to examine changes in users' affective and cognitive states over the course of interacting with an educational application. Chapman (1997) studied the relationship between engagement (as measured by Webster and Ho's instrument) and performance metrics, such as time on task (as gathered through log files) and knowledge of system content (as measured by multiple-choice quizzes) as a consequence of media format. One researcher posited that multiple measures (selfreport, participant observation, biometrics) are needed to study engagement but did not offer any results of empirical data collection or describe how these measures might be triangulated to say something meaningful about engagement (Champion, 2003). Performance indicators and physiological metrics have the advantage of being observed in users' biology (e.g., heart rate) or behaviors (e.g., eye gaze, mouse clicks) and collected over the course of an interaction with a system. Yet while metrics such as log analysis, number of eye fixations, heart rate, etc., answer the question of what is taking place during a user's interaction with a system, they do not address the users' cognitive or emotional state, both of which are critical to engagement. For example, Seah and Cairns (2008) found that conducting their study of immersion in video games in an experimental setting resulted in confounds they attributed to gamers' strong preferences for particular games. In addition, we do not have the ability to connect these metrics to engagement at this point in time. For instance, is a user \rule{1em}{1pt}engaged{$\Vert$} when they spend a great deal of time on a single screen of an application, or simply confused about how to navigate away from it? Increased attention, as measured through eye tracking, may signal heightened engagement, but focused attention may be one of many components of engagement, and thus this would give us an incomplete assessment. Furthermore, collecting physiological data may be obtrusive for some participants and interfere with the experience. Self-report measures are not as objective as performance and physiological measures, but they do offer a convenient and efficient means of assessing the users' perspective of an experience. As stated, a variety of researchers have developed survey instruments to evaluate engagement (e.g., Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques, 1996), but these have not been generalized to domains beyond the ones in which they were created and administered. In addition, the items contained in each of these instruments 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:54})
\par
"represent a small portion of the attributes of engagement found in our exploratory study (see O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). Existing measures of usability (e.g., The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction: http://www.lap.umd.edu/QUIS/index.html; The System Usability Questionnaire, Brooke, 1996) address the functionality of systems and users' satisfaction in using them, but do not tap into more experiential aspects of use, such as one's interest and motivation to use the application or continue using it, or the visual appearance of the interface, etc. Given the demands of today's technology users, it is essential to develop an instrument that encapsulates more than usability." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/6}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:55})
\par
"As in prior research, we believe that a survey instrument is the most appropriate technique for collecting users' perception of their level of engagement. Unlike prior research our earlier work strongly suggested that engagement was more broadly defined. As a result, we elected to build a scale that encompassed significantly more attributes than previous instruments. Such a scale would serve an added purpose: it could validate or refine the attributes identified in the earlier exploratory study. From a practical viewpoint, we envisioned that the resulting instrument would be an effective tool for comparing technologies (e.g., Website X and Website Y), collecting feedback during the design process of an application, or assessing users' responses to an existing system. The instrument would not only provide an overall evaluation of the user's experience, but would convey users' perceptions of the attributes."

"Aesthetics.

\par
"Novelty. Pace (2004) suggested that novelty in online content has the potential to sustain users' attention, specifically when novelty is introduced through links and content that are pertinent to users' goals. Pace emphasized the \rule{1em}{1pt}congruence{$\Vert$} between interest, novelty, and searchers' goals in directed attention. This is concurrent with the view that there is an \rule{1em}{1pt}optimal level{$\Vert$} of arousal; diverging from this level may have negative consequences for users' experiences (Hebb, 1972). The relationship between novelty and focused attention may be approached from the state-trait curiosity model (Boyle, 1983). Boyle stated that external and internal stimuli, as well as individual differences, combine to form a cognitive appraisal of a situation, which results in behavior."

"Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. In this work, the Focused Attention factor is defined by items pertaining to focused attention, awareness, and perceptions of time. These facets represent some, though not all, characteristics of Flow. Since prior research explored Flow and aspects of usability 21" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/21}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:70})
\par
"(e.g., Pace, 2004), this is a useful starting point for examining the relationship between Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. Pace (2004) found that the match between perceived challenge and searchers' skill was directly related to participants' ability to achieve a state of flow. Furthermore, Pace found that poor system usability, exemplified by lengthy response times, disorganized content, inconsistent navigation cues, cluttered page layout, etc., may interrupt flow by directing users' attention away from the salient aspects of the experience. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"Felt Involvement and Perceived Usability. The Felt Involvement factor contained items about how much fun users' were having during the interaction and how drawn in they were able to become. Mathwick and Ridgon (2004) found that the quality of users' interactions depended on the degree of challenge presented by an online search task, the skills they possessed to meet those challenges, and their perceptions of control over the interaction. Pace (2004) stated that poor usability could impede users' enjoyment. Based on this, it would seem that Perceived Usability would predict Felt Involvement. However, our instrument measures postexperience Perceived Usability. Therefore, if the user has experienced Felt Involvement, it is because the usability of the system did not interrupt or prevent them from enjoying themselves; in this situation, judgments of the Perceived Usability will be influenced by the level of involvement achieved. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"Endurability. Endurability is the assessment of users' perception of success with a task, and their willingness to use an application in future or recommend it to others. The Endurability factor is really the summation of the experience and is therefore positioned as the outcome variable in the model. Users' evaluations of the Aesthetics and Novelty of an application will influence their degree of Focused Attention and Felt Involvement, and subsequently their Perceived Usability of the system. All of these factors will predict users' lasting impressions of the experience and their willingness to engage with the application at another point in time. The final hypothesis is that" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"H6: Perceived Usability predicts Endurability From these predictions, a fully mediated model emerges where Perceived Usability mediates the relationship between the Endurability of the experience and the other four factors. In other words, Aesthetics, Novelty, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention are filtered by users' perceptions of the system's usability; this mediation leads to users' appraisal of the overall experience (see Figure 2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"The outcome of this research is a reliable and valid scale comprised of six distinct factors: Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, Endurability, Novelty, Aesthetics, and Felt Involvement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/29}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:78})
\par
"Aesthetics and Novelty predicted the other factors in the model. This pairing suggests that developers make \rule{1em}{1pt}creative use{$\Vert$} of visual and sensory features as a means of attracting users' attention (Jacques, 1996, p. 93)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/30}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:79})
\par
"Generalizability. Our next goal is to examine the generalizability of the survey instrument in domains and applications outside of online shopping. Given that the same six factors emerged from the data collected with both general shoppers (Study 1) and customers of a particular retailer (Study 2), it is conceivable that the instrument could be generalized to other environments, such as the Web, digital libraries, or task-specific applications (e.g., bibliographic citation or qualitative data analysis software). Although constructs such as flow (e.g., Webster, Trevino, \& Ryan, 1993; Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), play (Mathwick \& Rigdon, 2004), and interactivity (Liu, 2003) have been studied in these contexts, engagement has not. Another issue in the generalizability of the scale is that previous research indicated that format influences engagement (Jacques et al., 1995)."

"Designing for engaging experiences is an oft-cited goal of interactive system development in many disciplines, yet there are no guidelines to channel designers' efforts to \rule{1em}{1pt}make things engaging{$\Vert$} (Overbeeke et al., 2003). Part of the issue has been that, until recently, there have been disparate ideas about what constitutes engagement. Without a consistent definition of engagement, it is difficult to ascertain that the systems we design and market are, in fact, engaging, or to identify what aspects of the interaction with technology engage or fail to engage users. Without a means of measuring engagement, we are limited in our understanding of this quality of user experience and our evaluations of user-centered technologies."

"Until recently, engagement was articulated loosely as a cognitive (Laurel, 1993), affective (specifically intrinsic motivation) (Jacques, 1996; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Jones, n.d.), and behavioral (Kappelman, 1995; Hutchins, Holland, \& Norman, 1986) state of interaction with a computer application that \rule{1em}{1pt}makes the [user] want to be there{$\Vert$} (Jones, n.d.). Engaging interactions were thought to involve attention (Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), intrinsic interest (Jacques, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), interactivity (Quesenbury, 2003), perceived control and choice (Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997), functionality (Jacques et al., 1995), and motivation ( Makkonen, 1997). This collection of attributes was derived from studies carried out in multiple disciplines (i.e., education, e-commerce, human-computer interaction, etc.) with varied applications, including educational multimedia (Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999) and presentation software (Webster \& Ho, 1997), print and online reading (Schraw, Flowerday, \& Reisetter, 1998; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001), museum exhibits (Haywood \& Cairns, 2005; Hull \& Reid, 2003), and video games (Reiber, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Overall, the model hypothesized that engagement is both a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users' needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury, 2003)."

"Measuring Engagement It has been stated that there is sparse empirical research about how engagement should be measured (Chapman, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). However, over the past 15 years a number of researchers have purported to measure engagement using a variety of data collection techniques. The most common of these has been self-report measures, including Webster and Ho's (1997) seven-item questionnaire with items pertaining to attention, challenge, intrinsic interest, and variety, and Jacques' (1996) 13- item survey containing items that related to attention, perceived time, motivation, needs, control, attitudes, and overall engagement. Some researchers have used performance indicators, not as measures of engagement, but as correlates of engagement. For example, Konradt and Sultz (2001) employed preand post-task measures to examine changes in users' affective and cognitive states over the course of interacting with an educational application. Chapman (1997) studied the relationship between engagement (as measured by Webster and Ho's instrument) and performance metrics, such as time on task (as gathered through log files) and knowledge of system content (as measured by multiple-choice quizzes) as a consequence of media format. One researcher posited that multiple measures (selfreport, participant observation, biometrics) are needed to study engagement but did not offer any results of empirical data collection or describe how these measures might be triangulated to say something meaningful about engagement (Champion, 2003). Performance indicators and physiological metrics have the advantage of being observed in users' biology (e.g., heart rate) or behaviors (e.g., eye gaze, mouse clicks) and collected over the course of an interaction with a system. Yet while metrics such as log analysis, number of eye fixations, heart rate, etc., answer the question of what is taking place during a user's interaction with a system, they do not address the users' cognitive or emotional state, both of which are critical to engagement. For example, Seah and Cairns (2008) found that conducting their study of immersion in video games in an experimental setting resulted in confounds they attributed to gamers' strong preferences for particular games. In addition, we do not have the ability to connect these metrics to engagement at this point in time. For instance, is a user \rule{1em}{1pt}engaged{$\Vert$} when they spend a great deal of time on a single screen of an application, or simply confused about how to navigate away from it? Increased attention, as measured through eye tracking, may signal heightened engagement, but focused attention may be one of many components of engagement, and thus this would give us an incomplete assessment. Furthermore, collecting physiological data may be obtrusive for some participants and interfere with the experience. Self-report measures are not as objective as performance and physiological measures, but they do offer a convenient and efficient means of assessing the users' perspective of an experience. As stated, a variety of researchers have developed survey instruments to evaluate engagement (e.g., Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques, 1996), but these have not been generalized to domains beyond the ones in which they were created and administered.

"Generalizability. Our next goal is to examine the generalizability of the survey instrument in domains and applications outside of online shopping. Given that the same six factors emerged from the data collected with both general shoppers (Study 1) and customers of a particular retailer (Study 2), it is conceivable that the instrument could be generalized to other environments, such as the Web, digital libraries, or task-specific applications (e.g., bibliographic citation or qualitative data analysis software). Although constructs such as flow (e.g., Webster, Trevino, \& Ryan, 1993; Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), play (Mathwick \& Rigdon, 2004), and interactivity (Liu, 2003) have been studied in these contexts, engagement has not.

"Lastly, biometrics (e.g., galvanic skin response, heart rate, electromyography of the jaw, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude) may be another route for assessing the criterion validity of the engagement instrument. Research has attempted to relate physical and subjective measures of fun in video games (Mandryk, 2004) using biometrics. Given the obtrusiveness of biometrics, and the fact that conducting usability, physiological, and eye tracking studies can be involved and require special, costly equipment, demonstrating the criterion validity of the scale may offer the design and research communities a more cost-effective, quick, and accessible means of evaluating user engagement with technologies and be used in various stages of interface design. Another aspect of future work is to address its relationship with other scales (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model, Cognitive Absorption, etc.) in order to ascertain whether the Engagement Scale correlates with other measures. This will enable us to examine theoretical/empirical redundancies and differences (Clark \& Watson, 1995) between the Engagement Scale and other metrics."

These results also have implications for evaluating the holistic nature of user experience.

For example, Tractinsky (1997; Tractinsky, Katz, \& Ikar, 2000), as well as Shenkman \& Jonsson (2000), brought awareness to how the aesthetic qualities of interfaces influenced users' judgments of the usability and the selection of information content.

"Designing for engaging experiences is an oft-cited goal of interactive system development in many disciplines, yet there are no guidelines to channel designers' efforts to \rule{1em}{1pt}make things engaging{$\Vert$} (Overbeeke et al., 2003). Part of the issue has been that, until recently, there have been disparate ideas about what constitutes engagement. Without a consistent definition of engagement, it is difficult to ascertain that the systems we design and market are, in fact, engaging, or to identify what aspects of the interaction with technology engage or fail to engage users. Without a means of measuring engagement, we are limited in our understanding of this quality of user experience and our evaluations of user-centered technologies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:51})
\par
"O'Brien \& Toms (2008) drew together the threads of multiple research projects to identify the core attributes that constitute engaging experiences, and to propose a conceptual, process-based model of engagement that was founded on Aesthetic, Flow, and Play Theories. This" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:51})
\par
"This was followed by an exploratory study that tested the model and confirmed the attributes. This multistage process standardized the concept engagement and illuminated its essence." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/2}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:51})
\par
"Until recently, engagement was articulated loosely as a cognitive (Laurel, 1993), affective (specifically intrinsic motivation) (Jacques, 1996; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Jones, n.d.), and behavioral (Kappelman, 1995; Hutchins, Holland, \& Norman, 1986) state of interaction with a computer application that \rule{1em}{1pt}makes the [user] want to be there{$\Vert$} (Jones, n.d.). Engaging interactions were thought to involve attention (Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), intrinsic interest (Jacques, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), interactivity (Quesenbury, 2003), perceived control and choice (Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997), functionality (Jacques et al., 1995), and motivation ( Makkonen, 1997). This collection of attributes was derived from studies carried out in multiple disciplines (i.e., education, e-commerce, human-computer interaction, etc.) with varied applications, including educational multimedia (Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999) and presentation software (Webster \& Ho, 1997), print and online reading (Schraw, Flowerday, \& Reisetter, 1998; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001), museum exhibits (Haywood \& Cairns, 2005; Hull \& Reid, 2003), and video games (Reiber, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"As a group, these studies provide a view of engagement through a wide interdisciplinary lens and offer numerous insights into what it means to be engaged in a variety of information-rich contexts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"A Model of User Engagement Building on this previous research, we posited a model of engagement that examined these attributes in concert and rooted them in a theoretical framework of Aesthetic, Play, and Flow Theories, and then tested the model through an exploratory study that involved interviewing users of four different types of technology: Web searching, shopping, video games, and online learning" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Overall, the model hypothesized that engagement is both a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users' needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury, 2003)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"A range of user and system-specific attributes were identified in the review of related research and exploratory study: aesthetics, sensory appeal, focused attention, awareness, 3" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"challenge, control, feedback, interest, motivation, novelty, and perceived time. Influences on engagement are perceived usability, interactivity, and environmental/situational variables (e.g., interruptions, task pressures). Table 1 defines the attributes that were considered during the initial stages of this research. The articulation of these attributes provided a foundation for considering the measurement of engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/4}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:53})

"Measuring Engagement It has been stated that there is sparse empirical research about how engagement should be measured (Chapman, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). However, over the past 15 years a number of researchers have purported to measure engagement using a variety of data collection techniques. The most common of these has been self-report measures, including Webster and Ho's (1997) seven-item questionnaire with items pertaining to attention, challenge, intrinsic interest, and variety, and Jacques' (1996) 13- item survey containing items that related to attention, perceived time, motivation, needs, control, attitudes, and overall engagement. Some researchers have used performance indicators, not as measures of engagement, but as correlates of engagement. For example, Konradt and Sultz (2001) employed preand post-task measures to examine changes in users' affective and cognitive states over the course of interacting with an educational application. Chapman (1997) studied the relationship between engagement (as measured by Webster and Ho's instrument) and performance metrics, such as time on task (as gathered through log files) and knowledge of system content (as measured by multiple-choice quizzes) as a consequence of media format. One researcher posited that multiple measures (selfreport, participant observation, biometrics) are needed to study engagement but did not offer any results of empirical data collection or describe how these measures might be triangulated to say something meaningful about engagement (Champion, 2003). Performance indicators and physiological metrics have the advantage of being observed in users' biology (e.g., heart rate) or behaviors (e.g., eye gaze, mouse clicks) and collected over the course of an interaction with a system. Yet while metrics such as log analysis, number of eye fixations, heart rate, etc., answer the question of what is taking place during a user's interaction with a system, they do not address the users' cognitive or emotional state, both of which are critical to engagement. For example, Seah and Cairns (2008) found that conducting their study of immersion in video games in an experimental setting resulted in confounds they attributed to gamers' strong preferences for particular games. In addition, we do not have the ability to connect these metrics to engagement at this point in time. For instance, is a user \rule{1em}{1pt}engaged{$\Vert$} when they spend a great deal of time on a single screen of an application, or simply confused about how to navigate away from it? Increased attention, as measured through eye tracking, may signal heightened engagement, but focused attention may be one of many components of engagement, and thus this would give us an incomplete assessment. Furthermore, collecting physiological data may be obtrusive for some participants and interfere with the experience. Self-report measures are not as objective as performance and physiological measures, but they do offer a convenient and efficient means of assessing the users' perspective of an experience. As stated, a variety of researchers have developed survey instruments to evaluate engagement (e.g., Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques, 1996), but these have not been generalized to domains beyond the ones in which they were created and administered. In addition, the items contained in each of these instruments 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:54})

Existing measures of usability (e.g., The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction: http://www.lap.umd.edu/QUIS/index.html; The System Usability Questionnaire, Brooke, 1996) address the functionality of systems and users' satisfaction in using them, but do not tap into more experiential aspects of use, such as one's interest and motivation to use the application or continue using it, or the visual appearance of the interface, etc. Given the demands of today's technology users, it is essential to develop an instrument that encapsulates more than usability."

"As in prior research, we believe that a survey instrument is the most appropriate technique for collecting users' perception of their level of engagement. Unlike prior research our earlier work strongly suggested that engagement was more broadly defined. As a result, we elected to build a scale that encompassed significantly more attributes than previous instruments. Such a scale would serve an added purpose: it could validate or refine the attributes identified in the earlier exploratory study. From a practical viewpoint, we envisioned that the resulting instrument would be an effective tool for comparing technologies (e.g., Website X and Website Y), collecting feedback during the design process of an application, or assessing users' responses to an existing system. The instrument would not only provide an overall evaluation of the user's experience, but would convey users' perceptions of the attributes."

This is concurrent with the view that there is an \rule{1em}{1pt}optimal level{$\Vert$} of arousal; diverging from this level may have negative consequences for users' experiences (Hebb, 1972). The relationship between novelty and focused attention may be approached from the state-trait curiosity model (Boyle, 1983). Boyle stated that external and internal stimuli, as well as individual differences, combine to form a cognitive appraisal of a situation, which results in behavior."

"(e.g., Pace, 2004), this is a useful starting point for examining the relationship between Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. Pace (2004) found that the match between perceived challenge and searchers' skill was directly related to participants' ability to achieve a state of flow. Furthermore, Pace found that poor system usability, exemplified by lengthy response times, disorganized content, inconsistent navigation cues, cluttered page layout, etc., may interrupt flow by directing users' attention away from the salient aspects of the experience. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})

"Felt Involvement and Perceived Usability. The Felt Involvement factor contained items about how much fun users' were having during the interaction and how drawn in they were able to become. Mathwick and Ridgon (2004) found that the quality of users' interactions depended on the degree of challenge presented by an online search task, the skills they possessed to meet those challenges, and their perceptions of control over the interaction. Pace (2004) stated that poor usability could impede users' enjoyment. Based on this, it would seem that Perceived Usability would predict Felt Involvement. However, our instrument measures postexperience Perceived Usability. Therefore, if the user has experienced Felt Involvement, it is because the usability of the system did not interrupt or prevent them from enjoying themselves; in this situation, judgments of the Perceived Usability will be influenced by the level of involvement achieved. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})

"Endurability. Endurability is the assessment of users' perception of success with a task, and their willingness to use an application in future or recommend it to others. The Endurability factor is really the summation of the experience and is therefore positioned as the outcome variable in the model. Users' evaluations of the Aesthetics and Novelty of an application will influence their degree of Focused Attention and Felt Involvement, and subsequently their Perceived Usability of the system. All of these factors will predict users' lasting impressions of the experience and their willingness to engage with the application at another point in time. The final hypothesis is that" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"H6: Perceived Usability predicts Endurability From these predictions, a fully mediated model emerges where Perceived Usability mediates the relationship between the Endurability of the experience and the other four factors. In other words, Aesthetics, Novelty, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention are filtered by users' perceptions of the system's usability; this mediation leads to users' appraisal of the overall experience (see Figure 2)."

"The Composition of the Engagement Survey: From Subscale to Factors Initially we proposed a range of attributes: aesthetics, focused attention, awareness, challenge, control, feedback, interest, motivation, novelty, perceived time, continued use, etc., in the compilation of subscales. Preliminary data analysis in Study 1 demonstrated that these subscales were internally consistent prior to performing EFA. Yet EFA yielded six factors, rather than 10 subscales, where only novelty and aesthetics translated directly into factors. The remaining four factors contained items from the remaining eight subscales. For example, the Focused Attention factor included items from the engagement and perceived time subscales, as well as attention; the Perceived Usability factor consisted of items from the affect, challenge, control, and feedback subscales; and items from the affect and motivation subscales contributed to the Felt Involvement and Endurability factors. Felt Involvement also consisted of some engagement items; Endurability had items from the reengagement subscale. The composition of these factors was supported by the results of Study 2." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/29}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:78})

"Aesthetics and Novelty predicted the other factors in the model.

\par
"Generalizability. Our next goal is to examine the generalizability of the survey instrument in domains and applications outside of online shopping. Given that the same six factors emerged from the data collected with both general shoppers (Study 1) and customers of a particular retailer (Study 2), it is conceivable that the instrument could be generalized to other environments, such as the Web, digital libraries, or task-specific applications (e.g., bibliographic citation or qualitative data analysis software). Although constructs such as flow (e.g., Webster, Trevino, \& Ryan, 1993; Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), play (Mathwick \& Rigdon, 2004), and interactivity (Liu, 2003) have been studied in these contexts, engagement has not. Another issue in the generalizability of the scale is that previous research indicated that format influences engagement (Jacques et al., 1995)."

"Lastly, biometrics (e.g., galvanic skin response, heart rate, electromyography of the jaw, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude) may be another route for assessing the criterion validity of the engagement instrument. Research has attempted to relate physical and subjective measures of fun in video games (Mandryk, 2004) using biometrics. Given the obtrusiveness of biometrics, and the fact that conducting usability, physiological, and eye tracking studies can be involved and require special, costly equipment, demonstrating the criterion validity of the scale may offer the design and research communities a more cost-effective, quick, and accessible means of evaluating user engagement with technologies and be used in various stages of interface design. Another aspect of future work is to address its relationship with other scales (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model, Cognitive Absorption, etc.) in order to ascertain whether the Engagement Scale correlates with other measures. This will enable us to examine theoretical/empirical redundancies and differences (Clark \& Watson, 1995) between the Engagement Scale and other metrics."

"demonstrating that there is a need during the design process to consider \rule{1em}{1pt}the whole user experience{$\Vert$} rather than \rule{1em}{1pt}a single dimension{$\Vert$} (Quesenbury, 2003, p. 89). These results also have implications for evaluating the holistic nature of user experience. In the past, aesthetics, novelty, usability, etc., have typically been examined in isolation or in select sets. For example, Tractinsky (1997; Tractinsky, Katz, \& Ikar, 2000), as well as Shenkman \& Jonsson (2000), brought awareness to how the aesthetic qualities of interfaces influenced users' judgments of the usability and the selection of information content. We postulate that multiple factors of experience must be examined concurrently and are related to each other, and conclude that engagement, a quality of users experience with technology, is a multidimensional construct. Moving beyond measurement, the co-presence of multiple factors during experience will, in future, influence design guidelines. The survey instrument itself is a brief, easily administered, and statistically verified tool that may be used by software designers to assess their applications or by researchers for academic purposes. For example, one could use it to determine users' ratings of a Website's aesthetics or novelty. The instrument was derived from the concepts of actual users and previous metrics and, as a result, is more comprehensive than previous measures and expands the scope of how engagement has been characterized in the past. It consolidates disparate attributes (i.e., attention, challenge, curiosity, intrinsic interest, and control) (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999); curiosity, feedback, and challenge (Skelley et al., 1994), aesthetics (Chapman, 1997), and interaction, system format, and the presentation of the content (Jacques et al., 1995) into six factors that encompass the complex interaction between people and technology. The scale is a window into users' appraisals of the application and these perceptions are highly valuable in a marketplace, where there is a high degree of competition for users' time, interest, and money. Yet, its importance goes beyond the marketing of technology and into the fundamentals of what we are designing for and measuring in our work to enhance users' interactions with technology. The next wave of research is shifting beyond human-computer interaction to humancomputer experience; this represents the holistic and diverse relationships that people have with technology encountered in daily life. The scope of user experience\textemdash what one could be designing for and measuring\textemdash is broad. This work is a foundation upon which we can build a dialog about engagement, perform further testing of the model and scale, and examine additional methods for measuring the attributes and their relationships" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/33}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:82})

Of particular significance to the current study is external validity, or the pertinence of research findings to "the real world" [6].

"ABSTRACT Facilitating engaging user experiences is essential in the design of interactive systems. To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the composition of this construct and how to evaluate it. Building on previous work that posited a theory of engagement and identified a core set of attributes that operationalized this construct, we constructed and evaluated a multidimensional scale to measure user engagement. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, as well as two large-scale studies (N=440 and N=802) that were undertaken to assess its reliability and validity in online shopping environments. In the first we used Reliability Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify six attributes of engagement: Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Felt Involvement, Novelty, and Endurability. In the second we tested the validity of and relationships among those attributes using Structural Equation Modeling. The result of this research is a multidimensional scale that may be used to test the engagement of software applications. In addition, findings indicate that attributes of engagement are highly intertwined, a complex interplay of user-system interaction variables. Notably, Perceived Usability played a mediating role in the relationship between Endurability and Novelty, Aesthetics, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention."

There is an impetus for technology developers to exceed usability and provide an\\
experience. Today's consumers are making up their minds about what technologies to\\
invest their time, effort, and dollars in based on how they make them feel. Thus, the\\
question is no longer only whether an application is efficient, effective, or satisfying, but\\
how well it is able to engage users and provide them with an experience (Bannon, 2005;\\
Overbeeke et al., 2003). The experience movement is being driven both by the desire to\\
identify system features that facilitate positive user experiences and apply them to the\\
design of technologies (Lingaard, 2004), and to market beyond tangible goods and\\
services, and incorporate experience as a means of differentiating goods and services\\
in a competitive environment (Pine \& Gilmour, 1999).\\
Designing for engaging experiences is an oft-cited goal of interactive system\\
development in many disciplines, yet there are no guidelines to channel designers'\\
efforts to \rule{1em}{1pt}make things engaging{$\Vert$} (Overbeeke et al., 2003). Part of the issue has been\\
that, until recently, there have been disparate ideas about what constitutes\\
engagement. Without a consistent definition of engagement, it is difficult to ascertain\\
that the systems we design and market are, in fact, engaging, or to identify what\\
aspects of the interaction with technology engage or fail to engage users. Without a\\
means of measuring engagement, we are limited in our understanding of this quality of\\
user experience and our evaluations of user-centered technologies.\\
To resolve this problem, O'Brien \& Toms (2008) drew together the threads of multiple\\
research projects to identify the core attributes that constitute engaging experiences,\\
and to propose a conceptual, process-based model of engagement that was founded on\\
Aesthetic, Flow, and Play Theories. This was followed by an exploratory study that\\
tested the model and confirmed the attributes. This multistage process standardized the\\
concept engagement and illuminated its essence. This research follows that work by\\
focusing on the assessment of engagement. Reported here are the results of our\\
research that constructed and tested a means of evaluating engagement with\\
technology. In the process of doing so, we explored and verified attributes of\\
engagement and examined the relationship among them. The central questions guiding\\
this work were:\\
1. How can we measure engagement?\\
2. Would the attributes reported in O'Brien \& Toms (2008) be supported in the\\
current research?\\
3. What is the nature of the relationships amongst these attributes? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WC557WP2/2}{note on p.51})}

\par
"Until recently, engagement was articulated loosely as a cognitive (Laurel, 1993), affective (specifically intrinsic motivation) (Jacques, 1996; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995; Jones, n.d.), and behavioral (Kappelman, 1995; Hutchins, Holland, \& Norman, 1986) state of interaction with a computer application that \rule{1em}{1pt}makes the [user] want to be there{$\Vert$} (Jones, n.d.). Engaging interactions were thought to involve attention (Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), intrinsic interest (Jacques, 1996; Chapman, 1997; Webster \& Ho, 1997), interactivity (Quesenbury, 2003), perceived control and choice (Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997), functionality (Jacques et al., 1995), and motivation ( Makkonen, 1997). This collection of attributes was derived from studies carried out in multiple disciplines (i.e., education, e-commerce, human-computer interaction, etc.) with varied applications, including educational multimedia (Chapman, Selvarajah, \& Webster, 1999) and presentation software (Webster \& Ho, 1997), print and online reading (Schraw, Flowerday, \& Reisetter, 1998; Konradt \& Sulz, 2001), museum exhibits (Haywood \& Cairns, 2005; Hull \& Reid, 2003), and video games (Reiber, 1996)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Overall, the model hypothesized that engagement is both a process and product (Kappelman, 1995) of interaction; its intensity may change over the course of an interaction (Said, 2004) depending on the combination of users' needs, goals, emotions, actions, and thoughts, or the format (Chapman, 1997; Jacques, 1996), visual presentation, and organization of the computer interface (Quesenbury, 2003)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/3}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:52})
\par
"Measuring Engagement It has been stated that there is sparse empirical research about how engagement should be measured (Chapman, 1997; Jacques et al., 1995). However, over the past 15 years a number of researchers have purported to measure engagement using a variety of data collection techniques. The most common of these has been self-report measures, including Webster and Ho's (1997) seven-item questionnaire with items pertaining to attention, challenge, intrinsic interest, and variety, and Jacques' (1996) 13- item survey containing items that related to attention, perceived time, motivation, needs, control, attitudes, and overall engagement. Some researchers have used performance indicators, not as measures of engagement, but as correlates of engagement. For example, Konradt and Sultz (2001) employed preand post-task measures to examine changes in users' affective and cognitive states over the course of interacting with an educational application. Chapman (1997) studied the relationship between engagement (as measured by Webster and Ho's instrument) and performance metrics, such as time on task (as gathered through log files) and knowledge of system content (as measured by multiple-choice quizzes) as a consequence of media format. One researcher posited that multiple measures (selfreport, participant observation, biometrics) are needed to study engagement but did not offer any results of empirical data collection or describe how these measures might be triangulated to say something meaningful about engagement (Champion, 2003). Performance indicators and physiological metrics have the advantage of being observed in users' biology (e.g., heart rate) or behaviors (e.g., eye gaze, mouse clicks) and collected over the course of an interaction with a system. Yet while metrics such as log analysis, number of eye fixations, heart rate, etc., answer the question of what is taking place during a user's interaction with a system, they do not address the users' cognitive or emotional state, both of which are critical to engagement. For example, Seah and Cairns (2008) found that conducting their study of immersion in video games in an experimental setting resulted in confounds they attributed to gamers' strong preferences for particular games. In addition, we do not have the ability to connect these metrics to engagement at this point in time. For instance, is a user \rule{1em}{1pt}engaged{$\Vert$} when they spend a great deal of time on a single screen of an application, or simply confused about how to navigate away from it? Increased attention, as measured through eye tracking, may signal heightened engagement, but focused attention may be one of many components of engagement, and thus this would give us an incomplete assessment. Furthermore, collecting physiological data may be obtrusive for some participants and interfere with the experience. Self-report measures are not as objective as performance and physiological measures, but they do offer a convenient and efficient means of assessing the users' perspective of an experience. As stated, a variety of researchers have developed survey instruments to evaluate engagement (e.g., Webster \& Ho, 1997; Jacques, 1996), but these have not been generalized to domains beyond the ones in which they were created and administered. In addition, the items contained in each of these instruments 5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/5}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:54})
\par
"represent a small portion of the attributes of engagement found in our exploratory study (see O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). Existing measures of usability (e.g., The Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction: http://www.lap.umd.edu/QUIS/index.html; The System Usability Questionnaire, Brooke, 1996) address the functionality of systems and users' satisfaction in using them, but do not tap into more experiential aspects of use, such as one's interest and motivation to use the application or continue using it, or the visual appearance of the interface, etc. Given the demands of today's technology users, it is essential to develop an instrument that encapsulates more than usability."

\par
"As in prior research, we believe that a survey instrument is the most appropriate technique for collecting users' perception of their level of engagement. Unlike prior research our earlier work strongly suggested that engagement was more broadly defined. As a result, we elected to build a scale that encompassed significantly more attributes than previous instruments. Such a scale would serve an added purpose: it could validate or refine the attributes identified in the earlier exploratory study. From a practical viewpoint, we envisioned that the resulting instrument would be an effective tool for comparing technologies (e.g., Website X and Website Y), collecting feedback during the design process of an application, or assessing users' responses to an existing system. The instrument would not only provide an overall evaluation of the user's experience, but would convey users' perceptions of the attributes."

\par
"(e.g., Pace, 2004), this is a useful starting point for examining the relationship between Focused Attention and Perceived Usability. Pace (2004) found that the match between perceived challenge and searchers' skill was directly related to participants' ability to achieve a state of flow. Furthermore, Pace found that poor system usability, exemplified by lengthy response times, disorganized content, inconsistent navigation cues, cluttered page layout, etc., may interrupt flow by directing users' attention away from the salient aspects of the experience. Thus:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"Felt Involvement and Perceived Usability. The Felt Involvement factor contained items about how much fun users' were having during the interaction and how drawn in they were able to become. Mathwick and Ridgon (2004) found that the quality of users' interactions depended on the degree of challenge presented by an online search task, the skills they possessed to meet those challenges, and their perceptions of control over the interaction. Pace (2004) stated that poor usability could impede users' enjoyment. Based on this, it would seem that Perceived Usability would predict Felt Involvement. However, our instrument measures postexperience Perceived Usability. Therefore, if the user has experienced Felt Involvement, it is because the usability of the system did not interrupt or prevent them from enjoying themselves; in this situation, judgments of the Perceived Usability will be influenced by the level of involvement achieved.

Users' evaluations of the Aesthetics and Novelty of an application will influence their degree of Focused Attention and Felt Involvement, and subsequently their Perceived Usability of the system. All of these factors will predict users' lasting impressions of the experience and their willingness to engage with the application at another point in time. The final hypothesis is that" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"H6: Perceived Usability predicts Endurability From these predictions, a fully mediated model emerges where Perceived Usability mediates the relationship between the Endurability of the experience and the other four factors. In other words, Aesthetics, Novelty, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention are filtered by users' perceptions of the system's usability; this mediation leads to users' appraisal of the overall experience (see Figure 2)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/22}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:71})
\par
"The outcome of this research is a reliable and valid scale comprised of six distinct factors: Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, Endurability, Novelty, Aesthetics, and Felt Involvement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/29}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:78})

"Aesthetics and Novelty predicted the other factors in the model.

\par
"Generalizability. Our next goal is to examine the generalizability of the survey instrument in domains and applications outside of online shopping. Given that the same six factors emerged from the data collected with both general shoppers (Study 1) and customers of a particular retailer (Study 2), it is conceivable that the instrument could be generalized to other environments, such as the Web, digital libraries, or task-specific applications (e.g., bibliographic citation or qualitative data analysis software). Although constructs such as flow (e.g., Webster, Trevino, \& Ryan, 1993; Finneran \& Zhang, 2003), play (Mathwick \& Rigdon, 2004), and interactivity (Liu, 2003) have been studied in these contexts, engagement has not. Another issue in the generalizability of the scale is that previous research indicated that format influences engagement (Jacques et al., 1995)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/31}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:80})
\par
"Lastly, biometrics (e.g., galvanic skin response, heart rate, electromyography of the jaw, respiration rate, and respiration amplitude) may be another route for assessing the criterion validity of the engagement instrument. Research has attempted to relate physical and subjective measures of fun in video games (Mandryk, 2004) using biometrics. Given the obtrusiveness of biometrics, and the fact that conducting usability, physiological, and eye tracking studies can be involved and require special, costly equipment, demonstrating the criterion validity of the scale may offer the design and research communities a more cost-effective, quick, and accessible means of evaluating user engagement with technologies and be used in various stages of interface design. Another aspect of future work is to address its relationship with other scales (e.g., Technology Acceptance Model, Cognitive Absorption, etc.) in order to ascertain whether the Engagement Scale correlates with other measures. This will enable us to examine theoretical/empirical redundancies and differences (Clark \& Watson, 1995) between the Engagement Scale and other metrics."

"demonstrating that there is a need during the design process to consider \rule{1em}{1pt}the whole user experience{$\Vert$} rather than \rule{1em}{1pt}a single dimension{$\Vert$} (Quesenbury, 2003, p. 89). These results also have implications for evaluating the holistic nature of user experience. In the past, aesthetics, novelty, usability, etc., have typically been examined in isolation or in select sets. For example, Tractinsky (1997; Tractinsky, Katz, \& Ikar, 2000), as well as Shenkman \& Jonsson (2000), brought awareness to how the aesthetic qualities of interfaces influenced users' judgments of the usability and the selection of information content. We postulate that multiple factors of experience must be examined concurrently and are related to each other, and conclude that engagement, a quality of users experience with technology, is a multidimensional construct. Moving beyond measurement, the co-presence of multiple factors during experience will, in future, influence design guidelines. The survey instrument itself is a brief, easily administered, and statistically verified tool that may be used by software designers to assess their applications or by researchers for academic purposes. For example, one could use it to determine users' ratings of a Website's aesthetics or novelty. The instrument was derived from the concepts of actual users and previous metrics and, as a result, is more comprehensive than previous measures and expands the scope of how engagement has been characterized in the past. It consolidates disparate attributes (i.e., attention, challenge, curiosity, intrinsic interest, and control) (Webster \& Ho, 1997; Chapman et al., 1999); curiosity, feedback, and challenge (Skelley et al., 1994), aesthetics (Chapman, 1997), and interaction, system format, and the presentation of the content (Jacques et al., 1995) into six factors that encompass the complex interaction between people and technology. The scale is a window into users' appraisals of the application and these perceptions are highly valuable in a marketplace, where there is a high degree of competition for users' time, interest, and money. Yet, its importance goes beyond the marketing of technology and into the fundamentals of what we are designing for and measuring in our work to enhance users' interactions with technology. The next wave of research is shifting beyond human-computer interaction to humancomputer experience; this represents the holistic and diverse relationships that people have with technology encountered in daily life. The scope of user experience\textemdash what one could be designing for and measuring\textemdash is broad. This work is a foundation upon which we can build a dialog about engagement, perform further testing of the model and scale, and examine additional methods for measuring the attributes and their relationships" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6NRZEMR7/33}{O'Brien and Toms 2010:82})},

In order for this experience to unfold, the user must be motivated to initiate an interaction with the technology. This study explored hedonic and utilitarian motivations in the context of user engagement with online shopping. Factor analysis was performed to identify a parsimonious set of factors from the Hedonic and Utilitarian Shopping Motivation Scale and the User Engagement Scale based on responses from 802 shoppers. Multiple linear regression was used to test hypotheses with hedonic and utilitarian motivations (Idea, Social, Adventure/Gratification, Value and Achievement Shopping) and attributes of user engagement (Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, and Endurability). Results demonstrate the salience of Adventure/Gratification Shopping and Achievement Shopping Motivations to specific variables of user engagement in the e-commerce environment and provide considerations for the inclusion of different types of motivation into models of engaging user experiences.},

Engagement has been defined as both the act of emotionally involving users (Jacques et al., 1995) and the state of being in gear and interacting directly with a system (Hutchins et al., 1986). The consensus that engagement contains behavioural (i.e. visible actions (Kappelman, 1995), experimental, cognitive (Laurel, 1993), and affective (Jacques et al., 1995; Jones, 2005) components situates it within user experience frameworks, such as the Threads of Experience (Wright et al., 2003). O'Brien and Toms (O'Brien and Toms, 2008) used this framework to propose a process-based model of engagement consisting of a point of engagement, a period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement. They viewed the entire process as following the compositional thread, with the narrative of engagement unfolding as users progress through these stages. The stages of engagement were deconstructed to explore the sensual, emotional, and spatiotemporal threads of the experience, whereby aspects of the interface (e.g., novel presentation of the interface), users' perceptions of the system (e.g., lack of/ too much challenge in using the system), and users' assessment of the interaction (e.g., interest, positive or negative affect) were plotted. The attributes of engagement that arose from this research were focused attention, affect, aesthetic and sensory appeal, ease of use, challenge, control, feedback, motivation, novelty, and social involvement; this work united and articulated the behavioural, experimental, cognitive, and affective elements of engagement together in an all-encompassing model (O'Brien and Toms, 2008).

"called "the driver" of online shopping experiences and an influence on exploratory behaviour (Menon and Kahn, 2002; Monsuw\'e et al., 2004). Monsuw\'e et al. (2004) found that enjoyment, i.e., escapism, pleasure and arousal, and the functional aspects of systems (i.e., usefulness and ease of use) predicted attitudes about online shopping, which in turn influenced intentions to shop. Endurability pertains to individual's assessment of a shopping encounter as worthwhile, successful, and rewarding. As such, there should be congruence between this overall evaluation and the motivations that led the individual to initiate the experience. Thus, it is hypothesized that utilitarian (Achievement and Value) and hedonic (Social, Idea, Adventure/Gratification) Shopping Motivations predicts Endurability" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_893ZQG9N/5}{O'Brien 2010:348})

"Interactivity may be defined according to two dimensions: 1) control over content (e.g., accessing news content through preferred channels, such as news websites, RSS feeds, political blogs, etc., and being able to hyperlink to related content while reading news items); and 2) conversation, the sharing of news content via social networking tools and the ability to comment on news stories and view the opinions of others (Opgenhaffen, 2011)."

"information," the dichotomizing of which represents a "blind spot" in our field (Case, 2002, p. 102). There has been a longstanding concern for the utilitarian and cognitive aspects of information behavior" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/2}{O'Brien 2011:2})
\par
"First, an analysis of the information science, education, humancomputer interaction, and information systems fields was conducted to identify how researchers in each of these disciplines described and defined user engagement. Second, interviews were carried out with 17 people who described their experiences with e-learning, e-shopping, web searching, and gaming activities to understand how people described their engagement with these applications. The analysis of the literature and the interviews were used to develop and test a conceptual model and characteristics of engaging experiences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/3}{O'Brien 2011:3})
\par
"The model consists of distinct stages characterized by the presence of specific attributes (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). The point of engagement occurs when the user decides to invest in the interaction. It is precipitated by the aesthetic or novel aspects of the interface that work to capture users' attention and interest. The period of sustained engagement is characterized by the richness of the interface and its ability to maintain users' attention and interest, and to support the users' activities within the site. Disengagement occurs when the user "checks out" of the interaction either physically or mentally. It is typically associated with negative feelings of frustration brought about by poor usability or inappropriate levels of challenge that leave the user feeling overor underwhelmed. Distractions, interruptions, and time constraints also contribute to disengagement. However, disengagement may also occur simply because the user decides they have completed the activity and are satisfied with the experience. The user may decide to re-engage after disengaging, and this initiates the process again (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). Overall, the model demonstrates that information interactions are not static and that users' levels of attention, interest, etc. are changing during an encounter with an information system" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/3}{O'Brien 2011:3})
\par
"It represents a rich environment for investigating a range of behaviors (e.g., reading, searching and browsing), cognitions (e.g., deciding what to read, evaluating the content or way in which it is delivered) and affective (e.g., motivations) elements of users' experiences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/3}{O'Brien 2011:3})
\par
"Previous research in HCI and media studies has focused on users' motivations for reading online news (Flavi\'an \& Gurrea, 2009; Marshall, 2007) and their desire for choice and novelty (Toms, 2000) when selecting news content. These studies have identified the need to support different types of reading and browsing behaviors in the design of news interfaces. For example, Marshall (2007) describes how readers may approach news, either rapidly scanning to get a general sense of the overall content, or engaging in more in-depth, focused reading of specific news items. Toms (2000) advocates for news platforms that provide stable navigation aids to keep newsreaders oriented in the space, yet that also support browsing by presenting content that is diverse and novel, thereby promoting the discovery of that content."

"Similar to their e-shoppers, gamers, web searchers and e-learners, the newsreaders in the current study described the organization and aesthetic appeal of the news website as capturing their attention and interest" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})

\par
"when the aesthetic or interactive features of the website interfered with reading the news articles. In addition, articles that failed to offer novel information or involve the participant also led to disengagement. Some participants did not react positively or negatively to anything during the interaction, either because they saw the web in general as lacking novelty or interest, or because they compared interacting with the CBC news website with reading a print newspaper or using the website of other online news providers that incorporated more interactive elements." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"While there was evidence to suggest that, like participants in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) study, the newsreaders experienced the stages of engagement, there are some notable differences between the current and previous work. Firstly, O'Brien and Toms (2008) did not emphasize content in their model of engagement; rather they focused primarily on the characteristics of the system and how these were perceived and acted upon by users. However, content was an important quality of users' engagement when interacting with news websites. Thus, we suggest that the user engagement framework be broadened to incorporate content, and for more investigation of the relationship between the nature of the content and how it is presented through the interface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Secondly, engagement has generally been viewed as a positive experience, where negative emotions lead to disengagement (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). In this study, it was interesting to see the range of emotional words used to describe participants' reactions to news, and how perceptions changed during their interactions with a story. Stories that were serious,devastating, or depressing in subject matter were as compelling as those deemed humorous or feel-good; articles deemed to be boring became more interesting as they read further, and vice versa. Thus the experiencing of negative emotions may not necessarily deter engagement, and this is also worthy of further investigation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Some of the attributes that were situated in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) process model proved to be more salient in the current study." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Notably, novelty emerged as an important attribute of engagement in news websites, both for browsing and selecting articles, as well as reading them, a finding concurrent with Toms (2000). In some cases, novelty manifested in headlines or content that evoked curiosity because they were outside the norm." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
""personal interest" was the most important factor in whether and how long people would invest in reading news. According to Chu et al. (2009): "If there is no personal interest, even the best design may be unable to impact the reader's attention and recall of information" (p. 41). In the current study, people may have selected articles based on personal salience, but their ability to stay engaged in the story depended in part upon its novelty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})

"Some of the attributes that were situated in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) process model proved to be more salient in the current study. Notably, novelty emerged as an important attribute of engagement in news websites, both for browsing and selecting articles, as well as reading them, a finding concurrent with Toms (2000). In some cases, novelty manifested in headlines or content that evoked curiosity because they were outside the norm. In other circumstances, the topic or issue was not novel to the participant and it was selected because they could relate to it personally. However, if the content did not provide some new insight or information into the issue, participants became disengaged. This conflicts somewhat with previous research that determined that "personal interest" was the most important factor in whether and how long people would invest in reading news. According to Chu et al. (2009): "If there is no personal interest, even the best design may be unable to impact the reader's attention and recall of information" (p. 41). In the current study, people may have selected articles based on personal salience, but their ability to stay engaged in the story depended in part upon its novelty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Furthermore, some of the attributes described by O'Brien and Toms (2008) did not to map in the current study. For example, participants did not explicitly mention challenge, feedback, or control, although the usability of the website was discussed with respect to ease of use and navigation. Nor was there much mention of motivation or perceived time. The reason for the lack of emphasis on motivation may be that participants did not have diverse goals for interacting with the site because they were browsing news in a laboratory setting within the parameters of a simulated task scenario. Another reason may be that participants were asked about what they found most or least engaging, not about specific attributes in the model. In addition, participants were given a time frame and a task; therefore they did not disengage because they had reached a natural stopping point or were interrupted by their natural environments, which may have prevented them from thinking about the passing of time. Only one person commented that, though an article was long, it did not seem to be so because he was enjoying himself. Overall, the quasi-experimental setting may have hampered engagement for some newsreaders and certainly produced some different results to O'Brien and Toms (2008), who were drawing upon people's recollections of lived experiences."

"One thing that stands out when we examine what enhances and deters engagement is the significance of individual differences in how users perceived the news website and its content. The same elements of the website's structure and presentation that appealed and engaged some participants disengaged others" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/12}{O'Brien 2011:12})

\par
"Overall, participants in this study may be underscoring twotypes of engagement with online news: one that is rooted in the novelty and quality of the content - the need for "story" - and one dependent upon interactivity and aesthetic appeal. However, these cannot be wholly separated. The ability to capture users' attention and interest was facilitated by the structure and visual presentation of the interface, but also the expression of headlines and choice of images. Thus, if the interface fails to engage the user, the content may not matter; at the same time, the interface elements and the content may compliment each other and bring about an engaging experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/13}{O'Brien 2011:13})

"it is interesting that participants honed in on many of the attributes of engagement presented O'Brien and Toms (2008), and enhanced the model of engagement by underscoring the importance of content as well as the system to experiencing engagement."

Such domains must support browsing and discovery (Toms, 2000); yet they must also present content in ways that are meaningful to or captivating for the user and allow them to become involved with the content - be it text,images or other media" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/14}{O'Brien 2011:14})

"In conclusion, to appreciate information interaction in casual-leisure settings as an experience, it is imperative to investigate user engagement with both the reading of content and the platform used to present this content, so that we may understand the significance of each of these to the experience of various user groups. User engagement, with its emphasis on system, user, and task variables, can help us reach a broader understanding of human information experiences."

"O'Brien and Toms (2008) developed and refined a process based model of user engagement situated within McCarthy and Wright's (2004) Threads of Experience (i.e., sensual, emotional, spatio-temporal, and compositional)." (O'Brien 2011:3)
\par
"The model consists of distinct stages characterized by the presence of specific attributes (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). The point of engagement occurs when the user decides to invest in the interaction. It is precipitated by the aesthetic or novel aspects of the interface that work to capture users' attention and interest. The period of sustained engagement is characterized by the richness of the interface and its ability to maintain users' attention and interest, and to support the users' activities within the site. Disengagement occurs when the user "checks out" of the interaction either physically or mentally. It is typically associated with negative feelings of frustration brought about by poor usability or inappropriate levels of challenge that leave the user feeling overor underwhelmed. Distractions, interruptions, and time constraints also contribute to disengagement. However, disengagement may also occur simply because the user decides they have completed the activity and are satisfied with the experience. The user may decide to re-engage after disengaging, and this initiates the process again (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). Overall, the model demonstrates that information interactions are not static and that users' levels of attention, interest, etc. are changing during an encounter with an information system" (O'Brien 2011:3)
\par
"Previous research in HCI and media studies has focused on users' motivations for reading online news (Flavi\'an \& Gurrea, 2009; Marshall, 2007) and their desire for choice and novelty (Toms, 2000) when selecting news content." (O'Brien 2011:3)
\par
"These studies have identified the need to support different types of reading and browsing behaviors in the design of news interfaces. For example, Marshall (2007) describes how readers may approach news, either rapidly scanning to get a general sense of the overall content, or engaging in more in-depth, focused reading of specific news items" (O'Brien 2011:3)
\par
"n addition to examining people's motivations for reading news and their preferences for browsing news websites, others have focused on users' perceptions of interactive (Chung, 2008; Deuze, 2003) and personalized (Lavie, Sela, Oppenheim, Inbar \& Meyer, 2010) news interfaces. This work has concentrated on identifying levels of interactivity afforded by the" (O'Brien 2011:3)

"What remains to be explored is how these user (e.g., motivation, preference for choice and novelty) and system (e.g., browsability, interactivity, personalization) qualities come together to create an online news experience. What is the intersection of user and system variables during an interaction with an online news website? What makes interacting with online news engaging?" (O'Brien 2011:4)
\par
"CURRENT STUDY Online news reading and browsing has not been viewed through an experiential lens such as user engagement. The objectives were twofold: 1) to gain a broader understanding of users' engagement with online news in order to understand the interaction between individual and system variables on experience, and 2) to test the suitability of user engagement as a framework for exploring information behavior in the domain of online news. Interviews were conducted with 30 people who browsed a news website and selected three articles of interest that were appropriate to share in a social setting. The following sections elaborate on the method employed in this study and on the findings gleaned from semi-structured interviews with participants." (O'Brien 2011:4)

"Thirty people participated in this study. There were more males (N=19, 63.3\%) than females (N=11, 36.7\%) and 66.7\% (N=20) of the participants were students. This was a fairly educated sample, with 46.7\% (N=14) of the students enrolled in an undergraduate program, and 33.3\% (N=10) in a Masters program. Approximately one-third of the sample was between the ages of either 21 and 25 (N=11, 36.7\%) or 26 and 35 (N=10, 33.3\%). The remaining participants were between 19 and 20 (N=1, 3.3\%), 36 and 45 (N=3, 10\%), or over 55 (N=3, 10\%) years of age. The majority of participants reported that they read online or print news on a daily basis (N=18, 60\%) or several times a week (N=8, 26.7\%). No one indicated that they never read news; 3 people (10\%) and 1 person (3.3\%) indicated they read news on a weekly or monthly basis, respectively. None of the participants read news solely in print. Over half of the sample (N=16, 53.3\%) reported reading news both in print and online, while 46.7\% (N=14) said they read only online news. Four of the participants listed "CBC," the news website selected for this study, as a preferred news source" (O'Brien 2011:4)
\par
"News Website The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) news website (http://www.cbc.ca/news) was used in this study. The research was not affiliated with CBC. It was selected because it is typical of news websites in that it offers a variety of regional, national and international news and incorporates multimedia formats and interactive features. The following is a brief description of the website." (O'Brien 2011:4)
\par
"Procedure This quasi-experiment was conducted in a quiet room in a university building. A laptop with a 15-inch monitor was used. Morae screen capture software recorded the browsing session. Interviews were audio recorded using Livescribe Pulse Smartpen. Recruitment took place through email listservs and fliers posted around a university campus. Volunteers responded to the recruitment notices by emailing the researchers and setting up a convenient time to participate. The duration of the experiment was between 45-60 minutes. After participants consented to participate in the study, the experiment commenced. First, they completed a demographic questionnaire, which gathered information about their age, gender, and level of education, as well as news reading frequency, and preferred news sources. Next, they were introduced to the online news task.2 This study employed a simulated task scenario (Borlund, 2000) to situate participants' news reading. The purpose of the simulated task scenario was to bring realism to the study. It was designed to provide participants with some parameters for their interactions with online news (e.g., minimum number of articles to read/browse, time frame, etc.), but was meant to be openended in order to facilitate choice, an attribute that has viewed as important to user engagement (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). You will be attending a social gathering this evening. It is a birthday party for a friend being held at a local restaurant. You do not know many of the guests in attendance. You thought it might facilitate meeting new people and taking part in conversations if you were up-to-date on some recent news. You decide to browse the CBC news website to see if there are any interesting items. You only have about 20 minutes before you have to start getting ready for the party. You decide that looking at one article might not give enough variety of information since you do not know the interests and backgrounds of the other guests. In the end, you determine that three articles would give you enough things to bring up in conversation. Participants were then asked to browse a news website in response to the scenario. The study was confined to one news website in order to keep the experiment as tightly controlled as" (O'Brien 2011:5)

"possible. The sample was asked not to select non-news content, such as weather or classified ads, but was otherwise uninhibited in their news reading. A time frame (20 minutes) was provided in the instructions to limit the variability of time on task between participants and to prevent participants from becoming fatigued, since the browsing/reading period was followed by an interview. The final component of the study was a talk-after interview facilitated through the playback feature of Morae. The interviewer scrolled through the browsing session and asked participants to identify the articles they selected for the scenario, pausing on each one and allowing it to play forward. This provided the participant and researcher with a frame of reference for the interview. A semi-structured interview script was followed in which participants were asked to describe and rate the articles they selected for the task and to comment on the news reading and browsing experience as a whole. After the interview, participants were thanked for their time, debriefed, and paid an honorarium for taking part." (O'Brien 2011:6)
\par
"FINDINGS This section highlights the findings of semi-structured interviews conducted with participants after they completed the simulated task scenario. (The quantitative data will be reported elsewhere to maintain appropriate length and scope for this paper.) Interviews were transcribed and explored using a grounded theory approach (Strauss \& Corbin, 1998). In this case, a more deductive approach was taken in the analysis because an objective was to examine news experiences within the existing framework of user engagement. The analysis focused on identifying previously defined attributes of engagement, such as interest, aesthetic appeal, etc., and participants' perceptions of the system they interacted with during the experiment. However, the semi-structured nature of the interviews meant that participants were not asked to comment specifically on these attributes, but to comment on the news reading/browsing experience as a whole. Therefore, the findings are a collective story of these 30 participants' perceptions of their experiences and are presented according to the stages of the process model proposed by O'Brien and Toms (2008) (i.e., point of engagement, engagement, disengagement, and non-engagement). As this was a laboratory-based study, it is not possible to determine if participants would re-engage with the website at a later time; therefore reengagement is not reported on." (O'Brien 2011:6)
\par
"Point of Engagement All participants began the task from the homepage of the news website. Participants formed initial impressions about the website that influenced the trajectory of their experience. The presentation of the interface led to evaluations about the website's usability and presentation." (O'Brien 2011:6)
\par
"Usability and Presentation of the News Website With respect to usability, some participants surveyed the navigational features of the website positively. For instance, they commented on the "easily laid out sections" (P27) and appreciated the "clear categories" (P24) of news by topic or geographic location (P25). Its appearance was in line with expectations of what a news site should look like according to participant 6: "it's clearly a news site". Two participants remarked that there were sufficient options for browsing the content of the site (P2, P7)" (O'Brien 2011:6)
\par
"Engaging with Content The articles played a major role in sustaining participants' engagement in the experience. Engaging content maintained users' curiosity and felt involvement in the articles. News stories were viewed positively when they looked at issues from a different perspective, or linked seemingly unrelated topics together. Some examples of novel content were a report about a scientific study to map emotions through social networking applications (P2)," (O'Brien 2011:7)
\par
"Whereas some people were drawn to novel news on topics that they might not typically peruse, others indicated that their interests and preferences determined their engagement, according to how well they were able to relate to the content. Finding a personal connection helped people become "excited" (P15) about the experience" (O'Brien 2011:8)
\par
"These interviewees described their news selections as salient when the article contained current information on news they had been following (P8; P15)," (O'Brien 2011:8)
\par
"Disengagement The same components of the experience that engaged some participants disengaged others who took part in the study. This section describes how elements of the website (usability, aesthetic appeal) and content (novelty) led some individuals to feel disengaged" (O'Brien 2011:8)
\par
"Disengaging with the Website Some participants judged the usability and aesthetic appeal of the news website as poor. For these participants, the layout was "very cluttered" (P12), "distracting" (P26), "busy" (P30), "convoluted," and "difficult to navigate" (P11). They described being frustrated (P15), "annoyed" (P19), and "losing interest" (P26) because of the layout (everything was "squished to one side" [P15]; "wasn't laid out the way I'd have chosen" [P6]), or the selection of items on the front page made them wonder what content was not in view but perhaps worth reading (P6); these people were left wanting "more variety" (P8)." (O'Brien 2011:8)
\par
"Negative initial impressions of the aesthetic elements were that the color scheme was "very plain" (P18), "kind of dark" (P21), and "very bland" (P20). One person reacted strongly to the use of red (P19), and another said, 'the gray immediately just says boring to me, uninteresting" (P20). In addition to the colors, some participants commented negatively on the legibility of the text. For example, one individual talked about the size of the menu font as affecting his ability to" (O'Brien 2011:8)
\par
"The findings of this study corroborate the process model proposed by O'Brien \& Toms (2008) yet also pose some interesting discrepancies." (O'Brien 2011:11)
\par
"While there was evidence to suggest that, like participants in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) study, the newsreaders experienced the stages of engagement, there are some notable differences between the current and previous work. Firstly, O'Brien and Toms (2008) did not emphasize content in their model of engagement; rather they focused primarily on the characteristics of the system and how these were perceived and acted upon by users. However, content was an important quality of users' engagement when interacting with news websites. Thus, we suggest that the user engagement framework be broadened to incorporate content, and for more investigation of the relationship between the nature of the content and how it is presented through the interface." (O'Brien 2011:11)
\par
"Secondly, engagement has generally been viewed as a positive experience, where negative emotions lead to disengagement (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). In this study, it was interesting to see the range of emotional words used to describe participants' reactions to news, and how perceptions changed during their interactions with a story. Stories that were serious,devastating, or depressing in subject matter were as compelling as those deemed humorous or feel-good; articles deemed to be boring became more interesting as they read further, and vice versa. Thus the experiencing of negative emotions may not necessarily deter engagement, and this is also worthy of further investigation." (O'Brien 2011:11)
\par
"Some of the attributes that were situated in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) process model proved to be more salient in the current study. Notably, novelty emerged as an important attribute of engagement in news websites, both for browsing and selecting articles, as well as reading them, a finding concurrent with Toms (2000)." (O'Brien 2011:11)
\par
"DISCUSSION The findings of this study corroborate the process model proposed by O'Brien \& Toms (2008) yet also pose some interesting discrepancies. Similar to their e-shoppers, gamers, web searchers and e-learners, the newsreaders in the current study described the organization and aesthetic appeal of the news website as capturing their attention and interest. In this specific domain, the use of images and headlines drew people to the content of the articles. As their interactions with the news website continued, usability and the presentation of the information continued to contribute to their experiences, but the novelty or personal relevance of the articles also influenced engagement. Disengagement occurred when users became frustrated trying to navigate the website or when the aesthetic or interactive features of the website interfered with reading the news articles. In addition, articles that failed to offer novel information or involve the participant also led to disengagement. Some participants did not react positively or negatively to anything during the interaction, either because they saw the web in general as lacking novelty or interest, or because they compared interacting with the CBC news website with reading a print newspaper or using the website of other online news providers that incorporated more interactive elements. While there was evidence to suggest that, like participants in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) study, the newsreaders experienced the stages of engagement, there are some notable differences between the current and previous work. Firstly, O'Brien and Toms (2008) did not emphasize content in their model of engagement; rather they focused primarily on the characteristics of the system and how these were perceived and acted upon by users. However, content was an important quality of users' engagement when interacting with news websites. Thus, we suggest that the user engagement framework be broadened to incorporate content, and for more investigation of the relationship between the nature of the content and how it is presented through the interface. Secondly, engagement has generally been viewed as a positive experience, where negative emotions lead to disengagement (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). In this study, it was interesting to see the range of emotional words used to describe participants' reactions to news, and how perceptions changed during their interactions with a story. Stories that were serious,devastating, or depressing in subject matter were as compelling as those deemed humorous or feel-good; articles deemed to be boring became more interesting as they read further, and vice versa. Thus the experiencing of negative emotions may not necessarily deter engagement, and this is also worthy of further investigation. Some of the attributes that were situated in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) process model proved to be more salient in the current study. Notably, novelty emerged as an important attribute of engagement in news websites, both for browsing and selecting articles, as well as reading them, a finding concurrent with Toms (2000). In some cases, novelty manifested in headlines or content that evoked curiosity because they were outside the norm. In other circumstances, the topic or issue was not novel to the participant and it was selected because they could relate to it personally. However, if the content did not provide some new insight or information into the issue, participants became disengaged. This conflicts somewhat with previous research that determined that "personal interest" was the most important factor in whether and how long people would invest in reading news. According to Chu et al. (2009): "If there is no personal interest, even the best design may be unable to impact the reader's attention and recall of information" (p. 41). In the current study, people may have selected articles based on personal salience, but their ability to stay engaged in the story depended in part upon its novelty." (O'Brien 2011:11)
\par
"However, the controlled, laboratory setting does offer some fascinating insights that were not captured in the retrospective accounts of O'Brien and Toms' (2008) participants. By creating an experience for people using a simulated task scenario and directing them to a specific website, we were able to see not only what engages people, but also what deters engagement. In other words, we moved away from documenting an intrinsically meaningful experience and observe how different people react to and evaluate an interaction using the same interface and under the same circumstances." (O'Brien 2011:12)
\par
"One thing that stands out when we examine what enhances and deters engagement is the significance of individual differences in how users perceived the news website and its content" (O'Brien 2011:12)
\par
"After all, good browsing systems facilitate choice and interest through diversity (Toms, 2000) and it is recommended that personalization of news websites should not be "too specific and restricted" (Lavie et al., 2010, p. 487). However, while this works for some users to create visual interest, opportunities for serendipitous discovery, or experimentation with interactive features, it may be complex and overwhelming for others. Thus, it may detract from these users' experiences of interacting with news websites, especially if they have no interest in the interactive features, prefer to search for specific items or within particular categories, or are unable to focus on the content because they feel distracted." (O'Brien 2011:12)
\par
"Chung (2008) recommends that news providers introduce interactive features gradually to users to increase their comfort with interactivity." (O'Brien 2011:12)
\par
"In sum, while some users are seeking intellectual challenge and fulfillment, others are more drawn in by the different ways in which they can interact with the news website and its overall presentation" (O'Brien 2011:13)
\par
"Overall, participants in this study may be underscoring twotypes of engagement with online news: one that is rooted in the novelty and quality of the content - the need for "story" - and one dependent upon interactivity and aesthetic appeal. However, these cannot be wholly separated. The ability to capture users' attention and interest was facilitated by the structure and visual presentation of the interface, but also the expression of headlines and choice of images. Thus, if the interface fails to engage the user, the content may not matter; at the same time, the interface elements and the content may compliment each other and bring about an engaging experience." (O'Brien 2011:13)
\par
"Limitations In this study, a task scenario was used to provide some parameters for interacting with the news website and participants were asked to interact with a specific news provider, CBC news website. As indicated, participants completed a questionnaire about their news reading frequency and preferred sources before beginning the browsing session. Only four participants listed the CBC news website as a preferred source. Though more than four people may have been familiar with the news website, it was not listed as a preferred choice in the open-ended question. Thus many participants may have been either unfamiliar with or not fond of the site selected for this study. This may have limited some people's engagement with the website and the domain of online news. Future work could examine engagement using other methods, such as a diary or field study (e.g., Marshall, 2007). However, as previously stated, the experimental setting does afford an opportunity to contrast engaging and non-engaging user experiences, and this design demonstrated the significance of the users' perspective in the experience of engagement. It should be restated that participants were not asked specifically about the attributes of engagement in relation to the activity of reading and browsing news on the CBC website. Rather, they were asked about their overall perceptions of what made the experience engaging or not engaging and to rate their interest in the articles they read. Structured interviews that asked explicitly about the stages of engagement or the attributes may have produced different findings. Therefore, the themes derived in the analysis may not be representative of all participants. However, it is interesting that participants honed in on many of the attributes of engagement presented O'Brien and Toms (2008), and enhanced the model of engagement by underscoring the importance of content as well as the system to experiencing engagement. Our participants were primarily under the age of 35 (two-thirds) and had some university education. Based on previous research (Pew Research Centre, 2008), our sample fits the profile of avid online newsreaders. In addition, they consumed news through the Web or a combination of print and online media; none of the participants read print media only. Collectively, this demographic participates in a range of activities, such as locating for news via search engines and aggregator sites, reading blogs, emailing news stories to friends and family, and receiving news through social networking sites, customizable web pages, and portable devices such as cell phones (Pew Research Center, 2008,pp. 21, 50). Thus, it is likely that participants in this study were adept at navigating online news websites, comfortable reading news online, and open to online news experiences. Thus, their experiences may not be generalizable to the news reading public as a whole." (O'Brien 2011:13)
\par
"CONCLUSION The purpose of this paper was to illuminate users' experiences with online news and explore ways to document and make sense of this experience using O'Brien \& Toms' (2008) framework of user engagement. The findings demonstrate the complexity of users' interactions with information content and systems in online news environments. It also highlights the significance of what the individual brings to the experience, as evidenced in the polar reactions to the news website and content amongst engaged, disengaged, and non-engaged participants." (O'Brien 2011:14)
\par
"The current work builds upon research that has examined the motivations for reading online news (Flavi\'an \& Gurrea, 2009; Marshall, 2007) by exploring how users' expectations play out during an online news interaction, specifically their desire for novelty and interactivity. The results concur that users have varying perceptions about the interactive features of news websites (Chung, 2008), and that they approach news reading differently (Marshall, 2007). However, it also extends previous research by examining users' perceptions of system features, such as interactivity, and content in concert with user variables. Thus, user engagement offers a more holistic framework for thinking about users' experiences with online news and enables us to observe aspects of the interactivity of system, content, and uses and how these shape experiences with information and multimedia-rich systems" (O'Brien 2011:14)
\par
"In conclusion, to appreciate information interaction in casual-leisure settings as an experience, it is imperative to investigate user engagement with both the reading of content and the platform used to present this content, so that we may understand the significance of each of these to the experience of various user groups. User engagement, with its emphasis on system, user, and task variables, can help us reach a broader understanding of human information experiences." (O'Brien 2011:14)

Second, interviews were carried out with 17 people who described their experiences with e-learning, e-shopping, web searching, and gaming activities to understand how people described their engagement with these applications.

\par
"Similar to their e-shoppers, gamers, web searchers and e-learners, the newsreaders in the current study described the organization and aesthetic appeal of the news website as capturing their attention and interest" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"novelty or personal relevance of the articles also influenced engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"While there was evidence to suggest that, like participants in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) study, the newsreaders experienced the stages of engagement, there are some notable differences between the current and previous work. Firstly, O'Brien and Toms (2008) did not emphasize content in their model of engagement; rather they focused primarily on the characteristics of the system and how these were perceived and acted upon by users. However, content was an important quality of users' engagement when interacting with news websites. Thus, we suggest that the user engagement framework be broadened to incorporate content, and for more investigation of the relationship between the nature of the content and how it is presented through the interface." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Secondly, engagement has generally been viewed as a positive experience, where negative emotions lead to disengagement (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). In this study, it was interesting to see the range of emotional words used to describe participants' reactions to news, and how perceptions changed during their interactions with a story. Stories that were serious,devastating, or depressing in subject matter were as compelling as those deemed humorous or feel-good; articles deemed to be boring became more interesting as they read further, and vice versa. Thus the experiencing of negative emotions may not necessarily deter engagement, and this is also worthy of further investigation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Some of the attributes that were situated in O'Brien and Toms' (2008) process model proved to be more salient in the current study." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Notably, novelty emerged as an important attribute of engagement in news websites, both for browsing and selecting articles, as well as reading them, a finding concurrent with Toms (2000). In some cases, novelty manifested in headlines or content that evoked curiosity because they were outside the norm." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
""personal interest" was the most important factor in whether and how long people would invest in reading news. According to Chu et al. (2009): "If there is no personal interest, even the best design may be unable to impact the reader's attention and recall of information" (p. 41). In the current study, people may have selected articles based on personal salience, but their ability to stay engaged in the story depended in part upon its novelty." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/11}{O'Brien 2011:11})
\par
"Chung (2008) recommends that news providers introduce interactive features gradually to users to increase their comfort with interactivity." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/12}{O'Brien 2011:12})
\par
"The findings demonstrate the complexity of users' interactions with information content and systems in online news environments. It also highlights the significance of what the individual brings to the experience, as evidenced in the polar reactions to the news website and content amongst engaged, disengaged, and non-engaged participants." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/14}{O'Brien 2011:14})
\par
"The current work builds upon research that has examined the motivations for reading online news (Flavi\'an \& Gurrea, 2009; Marshall, 2007) by exploring how users' expectations play out during an online news interaction, specifically their desire for novelty and interactivity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_CU2K5FWF/14}{O'Brien 2011:14})

  abstract = {Introduction. We investigated how online news consumers select content in an explicitly social scenario using uses and gratification theory (UGT). Method. Participants (n=30) browsed an online news Website and selected three items. In a post-task interview, participants rated articles on interest, intellectual curiosity, and likelihood to share, and articulated their motivations for choosing each item. Analysis. The article (n=90) was the unit of analysis. Structured content analysis of the interview data involved classifying motivations according to UGT's categories of surveillance, social utility, personal identity, entertainment, and habit. We quantitatively examined interest, intellectual curiosity and willingness to share ratings. Results. Participants employed different strategies in selecting content. The prospect of making conversation influenced many participants to select content with broad appeal, and some made use of social features of the news Website to accomplish this. Surveillance and social utility motivations dominated selections; entertainment was a minor consideration. However, more personal considerations such as interest, a desire to keep up to date with world events, and alignment with point of view played an important role in selecting content. Conclusions. When seeking information to share with others, personal interest and curiosity play an important role in selection, but a wide range of situational factors and goals also come into play. Participants articulated nuanced considerations of how information could be used to forge connections with others, construct social interactions, and make an impression on others. Information seeking as a means of satisfying social needs is an area ripe for exploration in information behaviour research.},

  abstract = {User Engagement (UE) is a complex concept to investigate. The purpose of this book is not to constrain UE to one perspective, but to offer a well-rounded appreciation for UE across various domains and disciplines. The text begins with two foundational chapters that describe theoretical and methodological approaches to user engagement; the remaining contributions examine UE from different disciplinary perspectives and across a range of computer-mediated environments, including social and communications media, online search, eLearning, games, and eHealth. The book concludes by bringing together the cross-disciplinary perspectives presented in each chapter and proposing an agenda for future research in this area. The book will appeal to established and emerging academic and industry researchers looking to pursue research and its challenges. This includes scholars at all levels with an interest in user engagement with digital media, from students to experienced researchers, and professionals in the fields of computer science, web technology, information science, museum studies, learning and health sciences, human-computer interaction, information architecture and design, and creative arts.},

"Across a variety of digital domains, including health, learning, marketing and commerce, information searching, social media, news, and entertainment, there is an impetus to construct, evaluate, and design engaging user experiences. Engagement is about creating satisfied consumers, learners, and searchers, but this is only part of the story. Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change. Thus, it is critical to understand user engagement in an era where so many experiences and transactions are digitally mediated and hinge upon the ability to motivate, captivate, and compel" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/14}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14})
\par
"As the chapters in this book demonstrate, user engagement has been investigated by researchers in a variety of disciplines, each with their own unique lens. As UE scholars and professionals, we approach our work with particular ideologies and perspectives that have been shaped and honed through years of education and professional experience. Our theoretical stance informs how we propose to define, model, and measure UE. For example, let us imagine that we are interested in UE in eLearning." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/14}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14})
\par
"User engagement, as with other aspects of subjective user experience, is a complex phenomenon. Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome. Furthermore, all user-system interactions are situated in broader individual, organizational, and social contexts that both facilitate and constrain engagement."

\par
"engagement with instructional content is "a necessary precondition to learning" and this position is anchored in theory and application; case studies derived from an experiment and a massive open online course (MOOC) are used to reinforce the theoretically derived characteristics of engaging eLearning environments within these unique settings that vary in scale" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/16}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:16})

"In the chapter "User Engagement with Digital Health Technologies", Kostkova crafts her chapter on eHealth around four main areas of interest: knowledge or attitude change, impact at the point of care, integrative digital storytelling, and professional communities of practice (CoP). Each of these ideas is explored and illustrated with concrete examples of eHealth technologies designed and adapted to meet the needs of a specific group of health consumers or practitioners."

\par
"The author underscores the need to articulate the purpose of an eHealth technology before determining what mode of delivery and design is most appropriate for engaging the user. She also raises the conundrum that while it is fine to design "engaging" eHealth portals and environments, engagement cannot occur without, first, the awareness that they exist and, second, the ability to access them physically and intellectually."

"For example, behavioural signals are reliable when they are linked to cognitive and affective signals, yet on their own may be highly interpretive.

\textbf{"However, there are some ambiguities when we look critically at definitions of UE.} For example, Brandtzaeg et al.

"we might speculate further on how users' evaluations of content (credibility, relevance, informativeness) contribute to UE; there is already rich scholarship in the disciplines of information scienc" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/28}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:28})

"Colbert and Boodoo [14], for example, tested two versions of a bicycle repair website, one that was compliant with guidelines for online content and one that was non-compliant. They found that, while there were no differences in bounce rates or number of pages visited for each of the sites, web users spent more time interacting with the compliant version and returned to it more frequently. Significantly, this study attributed differences in behavioural engagement to the presentation of web content, rather than to differences in individuals or the tasks they aimed to accomplish with the website, as these were unknown to the researchers. Based on these findings, we might speculate further on how users' evaluations of content (credibility, relevance, informativeness) contribute to UE; there is already rich scholarship in the disciplines of information science [53] and communications [60] that can contribute to this line of inquiry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/28}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:28})

"I found that online news readers reported two distinct engagement paths: one group of participants emphasized the novelty and interestingness of news items, whereby" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/28}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:28})
\par
"One issue concerning scope is whether engagement is affective, behavioural, or cognitive in nature" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/29}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:29})
\par
"Engagement describes their [users'] intrinsically motivated attraction [to a system] and is expressed in cognitive, behavioural and affective terms" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/29}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:29})
\par
\textbf{"Existing definitions of UE are typically not limited to one type of technology (with the exception of [29]), but focus instead on the qualities of systems more broadly (e.g. aesthetic appeal) and how the system\textemdash and users' interactions with it\textemdash affects users' internal states (e.g. motivation, interest, attention). However, the temporal and contextual scope of UE is problematic, and we do not adequately distinguish it from other qualities of interactive experiences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/29}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:29})}
\par
"In addition to play, current definitions also do not distinguish UE from fun, cognitive absorption, or interest. In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/30}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30})
\par
"Hassenzahl [25] defined UX as "momentary, primarily evaluative feeling (good-bad) while interacting with a product or service"" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/31}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31})
\par
"In addition to UX, usability is another concept that is both distinct and interrelated. Quesenbery [49] categorized engagement as a component of usability, whereas I have argued that usability is a dimension of user engagement: usable systems do not necessarily evoke engaging experiences, but without a minimum level of usability, engagement with the system is not possible [38, 42]. Whether we look at usability as part of the engagement equation or UE as one aspect of usability determines the kinds of outcomes we expect from users' interactions with technology and our methodological and design approaches." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/31}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31})
\par
"Jacques [27] proposed the following attributes of engagement with educational multimedia systems: attention, motivation, perceived time, control, needs (experiential and utilitarian), and attitudes (feelings). I expanded this list to include ten different attributes of UE (aesthetic appeal, attention, challenge, endurability, feedback, interactivity, control, pleasure, sensory appeal, and variety/novelty) and looked at these in the narratives of gamers, searchers, online shoppers, and eLearners. I found that most\textemdash if not all\textemdash of these attributes manifested in users' engagement with these applications. In later work, I developed a self-report measure, the user engagement scale (UES), and reduced the number of attributes through factor" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/31}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:31})

"analysis to perceived usability, aesthetic appeal, novelty, felt involvement, focused attention, and endurability [38, 42]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/32}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32})
\par
"Jacques's work [27] heavily influenced my research, and there is much overlap in our approach to studying UE. For example, we both emphasized similar attributes, such as attention and motivation, though we looked at motivation from different perspectives" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/32}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32})
\par
"Jacques felt that intrinsic motivation was essential for UE within learning environments, whereas I explored utilitarian and hedonic motivations in my work with online shoppers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/32}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32})
\par
"Thus, the nature of UE's defining features\textemdash what they are and how they are manifested during engaging experiences\textemdash appears to be context and user dependent; this translates into the need for a fluid definition of UE. Constructing a flexible definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/32}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32})
\par
"definition while maintaining some consistency is not an easy undertaking. Less emphasis has been placed on accompanying features of UE, though there are some exceptions. Hyder devised and tested an elaborate model of engagement antecedents (e.g. aesthetics, product involvement, depth of navigation, etc.) and consequences (e.g. intention to purchase, perceived value, brand recall, etc.) in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/32}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:32})
\par
"in his study of e-commerce website engagement [26, p. 399]. He tested over 20 hypotheses, leading to the findings that aesthetics predicted website engagement, which consisted of positive affect, focused attention, challenge, curiosity, and involvement. Website engagement predicted consumers' perceptions of value, intention to purchase, the desire not to switch to competitors, as well as increased brand loyalty. Such studies can lead us to consider how to build more sophisticated models that take into consideration both antecedents and outcomes of UE so that we might evolve our understanding of UE's accompanying features."

[10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology.

"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts."

"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/42}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42})

"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]."

The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. {$\bullet$} User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. {$\bullet$} Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain.

"User experience can be considered as a process of decision making [51] and user reaction to interactive products. Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things.

"112 A. Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/135}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135})

"There is general consensus on the definition of attitude, that it involves placing value or judgment on something or someone. Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22].

"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/180}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180})

"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32].

"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/185}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185})

"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)."

"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/190}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190})

\par
"Rokhlenko et al. [39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

"This study also helps confirm that when participants are engaged, they tend to display deeper information processing behaviors such as reading and absorbing more content.

"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce.

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})

"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})

"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website\textemdash customization, multimodality, and contingency.

"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})

"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})
\par
"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model\textemdash collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome.

"Modelling User Experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"User experience can be considered as a process of decision making [51] and user reaction to interactive products. Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Interactivity stimulates user arousal and emotion, thereby intensifying user experience [25]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/130}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:130})

\par
"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50]. Understanding perception, i.e. how a product appears to users, involves aesthetics which is then combined with experience of interaction. Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/132}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132})
\par
"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/134}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:134})

\par
"112 A. Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/135}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135})

"Across a variety of digital domains, including health, learning, marketing and commerce, information searching, social media, news, and entertainment, there is an impetus to construct, evaluate, and design engaging user experiences. Engagement is about creating satisfied consumers, learners, and searchers, but this is only part of the story. Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change. Thus, it is critical to understand user engagement in an era where so many experiences and transactions are digitally mediated and hinge upon the ability to motivate, captivate, and compel" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/14}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14})

"Existing definitions of UE are typically not limited to one type of technology (with the exception of [29]), but focus instead on the qualities of systems more broadly (e.g. aesthetic appeal) and how the system\textemdash and users' interactions with it\textemdash affects users' internal states (e.g. motivation, interest, attention).

"In addition to play, current definitions also do not distinguish UE from fun, cognitive absorption, or interest. In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/30}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30})

"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/36}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36})

"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts."

"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/42}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42})
\par
"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]."

Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". {$\bullet$} User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. {$\bullet$} User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. {$\bullet$} Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain.

"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level.

"User experience can be considered as a process of decision making [51] and user reaction to interactive products. Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things.

"112 A. Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/135}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135})

"There is general consensus on the definition of attitude, that it involves placing value or judgment on something or someone. Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22]. This is of equal importance for patients and citizens who are looking after their own health and well-being." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/152}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:152})

"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/180}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180})

"Generally, the underlying assumption is greater frequency of certain behaviors, such as clicks and dwell times, indicates more engaged users. In other words, users who are more engaged will communicate more with the search system and communicate with it for a longer period of time."

"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32].

"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/185}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185})

"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)."

"Research has also shown that the content of the information sources with which a user interacts plays an important role in engagement. Arapakis et al. [3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/190}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190})

\par
"Rokhlenko et al. [39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce. Our literature review reveals that there are at least three common factors to define the concept of user engagement with media: (a) strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest toward the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation influenced by media content." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"One of the most common ways of defining user engagement with media is the degree to which users become cognitively and affectively focused on media content" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})

"Consumers are engaged when they feel inspired by an ad [12] or become cognitively committed and emotionally attached to the ad or brand website [29, 43," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website\textemdash customization, multimodality, and contingency.

"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})

"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})
\par
"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model\textemdash collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

"When it comes to media, visual imagery constructed in users' minds as a result of reading or watching a narrative is an indicator of the degree to which users are engaged in the story [26]. When technology engages users with a real-worldlike stimulus and elicits imagery engagement, it can persuade users\textemdash it enhances credibility of messages [57]; forms more confident, enduring, and resistant attitudes [25]; induces stronger beliefs and more positive attitudes about claims made on the website [17, 36]; and even leads to greater behavioral intention to actually perform the simulated behavior [54]."

"Across a variety of digital domains, including health, learning, marketing and commerce, information searching, social media, news, and entertainment, there is an impetus to construct, evaluate, and design engaging user experiences. Engagement is about creating satisfied consumers, learners, and searchers, but this is only part of the story. Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change. Thus, it is critical to understand user engagement in an era where so many experiences and transactions are digitally mediated and hinge upon the ability to motivate, captivate, and compel" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/14}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14})

As UE scholars and professionals, we approach our work with particular ideologies and perspectives that have been shaped and honed through years of education and professional experience.

"User engagement, as with other aspects of subjective user experience, is a complex phenomenon. Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome. Furthermore, all user-system interactions are situated in broader individual, organizational, and social contexts that both facilitate and constrain engagement."

"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/36}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36})

"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts."

"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/42}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42})
\par
"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]."

"The main unit of analysis for UE varies according to the interactive setting: people interact with content, systems, and the environment to bring about UE.

Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". {$\bullet$} User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. {$\bullet$} User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. {$\bullet$} Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain.

\par
"User experience can be considered as a process of decision making [51] and user reaction to interactive products. Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50]. Understanding perception, i.e. how a product appears to users, involves aesthetics which is then combined with experience of interaction.

\par
"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5]. Interaction, unexpected events and unusual and unpleasant stimuli all tend to increase arousal, and high arousal increases the strength of emotional experience."

\par
"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/134}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:134})

"112 A. Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/135}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135})

"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/180}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180})

[27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)."

\par
"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30].

"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})

"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach."

\par
"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model\textemdash collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

"Across a variety of digital domains, including health, learning, marketing and commerce, information searching, social media, news, and entertainment, there is an impetus to construct, evaluate, and design engaging user experiences. Engagement is about creating satisfied consumers, learners, and searchers, but this is only part of the story. Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change. Thus, it is critical to understand user engagement in an era where so many experiences and transactions are digitally mediated and hinge upon the ability to motivate, captivate, and compel" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/14}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14})

"As the chapters in this book demonstrate, user engagement has been investigated by researchers in a variety of disciplines, each with their own unique lens. As UE scholars and professionals, we approach our work with particular ideologies and perspectives that have been shaped and honed through years of education and professional experience. Our theoretical stance informs how we propose to define, model, and measure UE. For example, let us imagine that we are interested in UE in eLearning."

\par
"User engagement, as with other aspects of subjective user experience, is a complex phenomenon. Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome. Furthermore, all user-system interactions are situated in broader individual, organizational, and social contexts that both facilitate and constrain engagement."

"In addition to play, current definitions also do not distinguish UE from fun, cognitive absorption, or interest. In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/30}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30})

"In addition to UX, usability is another concept that is both distinct and interrelated. Quesenbery [49] categorized engagement as a component of usability, whereas I have argued that usability is a dimension of user engagement: usable systems do not necessarily evoke engaging experiences, but without a minimum level of usability, engagement with the system is not possible [38, 42].

"Thus, the nature of UE's defining features\textemdash what they are and how they are manifested during engaging experiences\textemdash appears to be context and user dependent; this translates into the need for a fluid definition of UE.

Such studies can lead us to consider how to build more sophisticated models that take into consideration both antecedents and outcomes of UE so that we might evolve our understanding of UE's accompanying features."

"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/36}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36})

"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts."

"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/42}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42})
\par
"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]."

Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". {$\bullet$} User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. {$\bullet$} User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. {$\bullet$} Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain.

"While some of these streams are automatically processed to some degree, only a limited amount of this information can be processed at a conscious, cognitive level.

"User experience can be considered as a process of decision making [51] and user reaction to interactive products. Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50].

"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/134}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:134})

"112 A. Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/135}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135})

"There is general consensus on the definition of attitude, that it involves placing value or judgment on something or someone. Fishbein and Ajzen suggest that "Attitude refers to a person's favourable or unfavourable evaluation of an object, event or person" [22] or "the degree to which performance of the behaviour is positively or negatively valued" [2]. In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22].

"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/180}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180})

"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32].

"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/185}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185})

[3] used the focused attention subscale of the UES in conjunction with other measures to observe what attributes of news articles and comments were important to participants. They examined several attributes: genre, sentimentality of the article (the richness of the emotional tone of the article), polarity (positivity or negativity), and time of publication" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/190}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:190})

\par
"Rokhlenko et al. [39] found that participants who spent a lot of time reading the content on a web page had higher recall for the advertisement images than participants who read less.

"Defining User Engagement with Interactive Media Although the term user engagement has been widely used in the field of communication, rigorous definitions of user engagement are scarce.

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})

\par
"Similarly, engagement with narrative has been defined as a story's success in "directing a reader's thought toward the story and its themes" [59, p. 437]. Narrative engagement is often called as "transportation," which refers to the feeling of being "lost" in a story whereby all mental systems and capacities become focused on events occurring in the narrative" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"Recently, Busselle and Bilandzic [11] developed a scale of narrative engagement that reflects the strength of the cognitive and emotional focus on the story: narrative understanding (ease in comprehending narrative), attentional focus (absence of distraction), emotional engagement (feeling for and with character), and narrative presence (sensation of leaving the actual world and entering the story)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/202}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:202})
\par
"Apart from user engagement driven by media content, researchers have also found that user engagement can be driven by the interface or task itself. User engagement with a multimedia system has been defined as a user's intrinsically motivated attraction to the system [15, 34] and "a state of playfulness which includes attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest" with the presentation of multimedia [75, p. 65]. Extending the previous definitions, Sundar [62] points out at least three factors that engage users with an interactive website\textemdash customization, multimodality, and contingency.

"O'Brien and Toms [45] proposed a comprehensive scale of user engagement in an e-commerce environment. They found that novelty and aesthetics of the website lead to focused attention to the website and involvement with a shopping task, which results in perceived usability of the system and willingness to use the system again and recommend it to others in the future. In their scale, novelty and aesthetics reflect users' attraction to the media system or interface, focused attention and felt involvement capture cognitive and emotional focus on media content, and the endurability of system use represents evaluations of success and voluntary participation to recommend the website to others" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})

"Oh et al. [46] explicated the concept of user engagement as a construct that has four dimensions: physical interactions, cognitive experience, absorption, and outreach through one's social network. User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})
\par
"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model\textemdash collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

"Across a variety of digital domains, including health, learning, marketing and commerce, information searching, social media, news, and entertainment, there is an impetus to construct, evaluate, and design engaging user experiences. Engagement is about creating satisfied consumers, learners, and searchers, but this is only part of the story. Engagement may be used as evidence that a business is meeting (or failing to meet) its performance outcomes and therefore has economic implications. Engagement may also mediate positive individual and social outcomes, such as learning and personal growth, collaboration and connectivity, civic participation, knowledge transfer, or health behaviour change. Thus, it is critical to understand user engagement in an era where so many experiences and transactions are digitally mediated and hinge upon the ability to motivate, captivate, and compel" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/14}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:14})

"User engagement, as with other aspects of subjective user experience, is a complex phenomenon. Users bring personal histories, knowledge, skills, and emotions to their interactions with technologies, while systems vary in terms of how they present and organize system features and content. When user and system meet, there is typically some kind of goal (i.e. what users hope to achieve) and one or more tasks (i.e. how users go about achieving their goal) instigating the interaction. Goals may be leisure or work oriented and therefore fuelled by different motivations; tasks may be clearly articulated or fuzzy in terms of how they will be performed and their anticipated outcome. Furthermore, all user-system interactions are situated in broader individual, organizational, and social contexts that both facilitate and constrain engagement."

In fact, some researchers have explicitly used engagement interchangeably with other terms including attention, interactivity [46, 61, 63], and cognitive load (i.e. the propensity to seek out and take on challenges) [57] because people need a means of operationalizing the concept. One way in which to distinguish some of these concepts would be to categorize some as personality driven, that is, cognitive absorption, and others as situational, that is, interest and fun [10], though we still need to consider the relationship amongst various kinds of subjective experiences in HCI" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/30}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:30})

"In summary, Flow and UE share many of the same attributes, though the degree and manifestation of these attributes may be what sets these concepts apart. Cairns et al. [10] make a similar argument about the relationship between Flow and immersion in the context of gaming, where immersion is defined according to the level of involvement experienced by the player and "total immersion" is akin to the Flow state or being "in the game". In distinguishing UE and Flow, we see that Flow necessitates challenge or intrinsic motivation, whereas UE may not. There is a close coupling of attention, interest, and affect inherent in both UE and Flow, but the presence of negative and positive affect may be what sets these types of experiences apart; Flow is a pleasurable experience, whereas UE may involve a more complex range of emotions. We might also speculate that UE and Flow form part of the same continuum of subjective experience where UE is necessary for Flow, but Flow is not necessary for UE: the engaged user may or may not move into a Flow state before disengaging with a technology. Nonetheless, the impact of Flow, and positive psychology more broadly, on UE research is apparent and far reaching." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/36}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:36})

"Dewey's Philosophy of Experience, originally intended for the field of education, is highly applicable to UX, as explored by McCarthy and Wright [33] with their "Threads of Experience" and more specifically to UE. In my own work, I derived a behavioural model of UE consisting of a point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement and subsequently mapped it to McCarthy and Wright's spatio-temporal, compositional, emotional, and sensual threads [33]. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by sensual qualities including aesthetic or "attention getting" elements and the novel presentation of information; motivation and interest formed the emotional thread at this stage of the engagement process [42, p. 948]. Qualitatively constructing the Process Model of UE and placing it within the larger context of the Threads of Experience gave me a richer, more holistic picture of UE as well as its constituent parts."

"The dissertation work of Richard Jacques in the mid-1990s made the first significant contribution to modeling UE. In a series of studies that ranged from card sorting to user-centered experiments, he proposed that engagement consisted of six attributes, each of which operated along a continuum. These components included the degree of attention (divided or focused), motivation to continue the task, perceived control (presence or absence), and needs satisfaction experienced by the user, as well as the user's perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by") and attitude (negative or positive) [27, p. 67]. Jacques believed that the lowest and highest levels of engagement would be obtained when users rested completely on one or the other end of this spectrum for all attributes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/42}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:42})
\par
"These premises were applied in my work over a decade later. The Process Model of UE (see also Sect. 3.2), based on critical incident interviews with users of different types of technologies, described a point of engagement that led to a sustained period of engagement; at some point, whether by choice or due to external factors (e.g. interruptions in the environment), participants disengaged from the interaction. This disengagement was sometimes followed by short-term or longterm reengagement. By segmenting engagement into concrete stages, I was able to identify attributes of UE that seemed most salient for that particular phase of the interaction. For example, the point of engagement was characterized by the aesthetic appeal and novelty of the interface, interest, motivation, or a specific or experiential goal to be achieved through the interaction [42]."

"The main unit of analysis for UE varies according to the interactive setting: people interact with content, systems, and the environment to bring about UE. Research studies should clarify the unit of analysis being examined. {$\bullet$} User engagement has affective, behavioural, and cognitive aspects. Researchers should attempt to account for the multifaceted nature of UE or clarify the aspect of UE being examined or measured, e.g. "behavioural engagement". {$\bullet$} User engagement is a quality of UX that is characterized by the depth of the actor's investment in the interaction; this investment may be defined temporally, emotionally, and/or cognitively. The attributes of UE we focus on and measure in a given study should be aligned with the kind of investment we propose to investigate. {$\bullet$} User engagement operates along a continuum from shallow to deep; the continuum is influenced by the nature of the interaction but also situational constraints and users' conscious and unconscious goals and needs. {$\bullet$} Context is an important variable in user engagement. Context may be discerned at different levels, from the personal to the social to the task or situation that precipitates the interaction and to the overarching technology domain.

\par
"User experience can be considered as a process of decision making [51] and user reaction to interactive products. Initial perceptions are followed by interactive experience leading to judgements about a product's worth [13]. While most experience is ultimately about utility, i.e. is this product useful for me?, to deliver utility, a product has to be easy to operate (usability) and fun (engagement) [6]. The decision to use or reject a product depends on the interplay of several criteria, namely, utility, usability, engagement and aesthetics [27, 42]. The relative importance of these criteria depends on the users and application domain; e.g. in games, fun and engagement are prioritized, whereas in work applications, usability and utility are more important. Furthermore, the judgement process and criteria importance vary over time" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"Products have to first attract and engage users and then persuade them to keep interacting until the promise of utility (or fun) is delivered. From the UE perspective, the decision to use may be governed more by users' perceptions of aesthetics, novelty and their experience of in-session interaction [25, 50], while from the longer-term UX perspective goals, tasks and functional support are more important [59]. However, the decision about using products is highly contextual; e.g. in games, the goal is enjoyment, so UE is the objective." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/129}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:129})
\par
"A summary of the UX judgement process [27] is illustrated in Fig. 1. The first stage (assess context) specifies the UX context of the product, users' motivations, goals and tasks, which have been widely acknowledged to affect UX judgement [18, 20, 30, 52]. This is followed by select criteria, which determine the influences on the decision. Interactivity is highlighted among the other criteria (functionality/content, brand, customization, aesthetics and usability) as this makes a key contribution to user experience. The criteria and context are then applied to users' perceptions with actual experience producing judgements about the quality of the UX that eventually determine product adoption."

"User engagement aims to excite and attract the user. This involves understanding how motivation and emotion may affect users' perception of experience resulting from design features that promote novelty, interest, aesthetics or the potential to fulfil a task-oriented or experiential goal [50]. Understanding perception, i.e. how a product appears to users, involves aesthetics which is then combined with experience of interaction. Both will produce an emotional reaction which the designer hopes is" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/132}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:132})
\par
"Emotions interact with the arousal mechanism, which can be considered as a dimension ranging from calmness to excitement [5]. Interaction, unexpected events and unusual and unpleasant stimuli all tend to increase arousal, and high arousal increases the strength of emotional experience."

\par
"Flow is the sense of engagement and being absorbed in an interactive experience. It is a tricky concept which generally involves interaction, resulting in intense self-absorption [54]. It is closely related to presence and immersion [68] which also contribute to absorption but describe perceptual rather than action-related experience. The concept involves optimal arousal produced by a "sweet spot" trade-off between challenge and difficulty on one hand and ease of operation and achievement on the other. If operating a UI is too difficult, we will get frustrated and discouraged and may give up, leaving us with negative emotions and adverse memory of the experience. In contrast, if operating the UI is too easy, then we get bored, our excitement (or arousal) decreases and we turn our attention to more interesting things. The trick is to keep interaction in the flow zone (see Fig. 3), an intuition appreciated by game designers." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/134}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:134})

\par
"112 A. Sutcliffe wider interpretations in social presence [45] versus spatial presence, and immersion can be interpreted differently according to the suspension of belief encountered in different types of media [68]. For example, being immersed in a good book or film involves one's imagination, whereas being immersed in virtual reality is bound by perception rather than imagination. For UE, immersion is perceptually oriented; for UX it may be argued that it is more goal and memory oriented. Presence is the sense of "being there" inside an interactive world [69] as a representation of yourself (embodied or immersed interaction). Embodied interaction is more complex than standard 2D interfaces, since you can control movement directly, manipulate objects in an almost natural manner and even feel objects if haptic feedback is provided. Virtual worlds become engaging because they invoke curiosity and arousal; it is clearly not reality but interaction becomes transparent, i.e. you are not aware of the computer, instead you become absorbed in the virtual graphical world. Fortunately, we do not need the experience of 3D CAVE VR technology for immersion; Desktop VR, which implements semi-3D graphical worlds on a PC with limited controls provided by a joystick, mouse or Wii device, can deliver engaging and absorbing interaction" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/135}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:135})

In the medical context, attitudes are important as the value or judgment a healthcare professional places on the information held within the portal may affect the impact this information has on their work [22].

"Engagement is a multifaceted concept, and approaches to studying it vary across disciplines. In the education field, engagement is often understood to be the extent to which a student interacts with classroom material; research in this area often focuses on how teachers can present this material in more interesting and inviting ways [29]. In organizational psychology, the focus has been on how to create a workplace where employees stay invigorated and enthusiastic [40]. In cognitive psychology, engagement is studied from the perspective of understanding goal orientation, perceived ability, and motivation [31]. The common thread in all this work is the focus on creating positive subjective experiences for people so they stay motivated while performing activities. Engagement in the context of information search systems research has been anchored by similar goals: discovering what makes an interface (and search) engaging, creating search interfaces that promote engagement, and, to a lesser extent, understanding how to measure engagement. An underlying assumption of this work is that engagement creates a more positive search experience." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/180}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:180})

"Lehmann et al. [27] define engagement as the "quality of the user experience associated with a desire to use the web application" (p. 1), they only use behavioral signals to measure engagement, which do not adequately capture the quality of the experience or a person's desire to use an application. Solid measurement of latent constructs such as engagement relies on clear conceptual definitions of what is being measured as well as a clear mapping between conceptual and operational definitions (i.e., measures)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"While much of the work has focused on using behavioral signals to measure engagement, O'Brien and colleagues [32-35] have used psychometric theory to create self-report measures to capture engagement. O'Brien and Toms [33] define engagement as a "category of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control" (p. 7). Building on this conceptual definition, O'Brien and Toms [34] created and evaluated a 31- item scale to measure engagement, called the user engagement scale (UES). Six attributes of engagement were identified using factor analysis: perceived usability, aesthetics, focused attention, felt involvement, novelty, and endurability, which capture the cognitive, affective, and usability-related attributes of user experience. The UES is one of the first instruments to measure engagement in the context of information search. Importantly, it has undergone extensive validity and reliability testing [33, 34]. It is also one of the first measures of engagement designed to help researchers who are working more closely with users; while many of the behavioralbased measures are useful in the context of large-scale search log analysis, they do not characterize the entire user experience" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/182}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:182})
\par
"Although the UES was initially evaluated in the context of e-commerce, it is increasingly being used to evaluate more general information search experiences [1, 4, 30]. Initial studies of its generalizability to the information search domain have been conducted [35] along with studies to understand its relationship to log data and other types of data such as physiological signals, eye tracking, and cursor movements [2, 32].

"Engagement was operationalized as when a system "holds [a subject's] attention and they are attracted to it for their intrinsic rewards" [20, p. 58] and was measured with a seven-item questionnaire that contained items such as "the site kept me totally absorbed in the browsing" or "the site held my attention" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/185}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:185})

"They hypothesized that different types of interaction modalities would lead to different levels of perceptual bandwidth or the "range of sensory and preliminary attentional resources available to individuals" (p. 1478), referring to the resources a person has for understanding and perceiving interactivity in an interface; Sundar et al. defined this conceptually as "users memory for interface content" (p. 1478)."

User engagement is a point on the user involvement continuum, which is marked by physical interactions with media and cognitive experience that lead to user absorption with content, finally cumulating as behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/203}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:203})
\par
"In this framework, users are attracted by visual features, sounds, motion, touch, and the novelty of interface and physically interact with the interface features by watching, clicking, swiping, hovering, etc. This physical interaction can serve to expand their cognitive experience, "the extent to which the user processes preliminary information from the interface as well as the media content, which is marked by an activation of the users' sensory mechanisms." Next, the stage called absorption summarizes previous definitions related to strong cognitive and emotional focus on media content. Absorption refers to the stage where the individual is consciously involved in an interaction, and more specifically with the content of the interaction, with almost complete attention in the activity. Finally, behavioral participation is called outreach in this model\textemdash collective, voluntary behavior of users that shares their thoughts regarding a specific media content."

"Some scholars argue that interactive media lead to shallow processing and superficial interaction with media content [13] and often prevent users from being immersed in a narrative [73]. By contrast, other studies have found that interactive media can promote further processing of media content when users are highly involved with the topic, by demanding more user actions and thereby resulting in systematic processing of content [41" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/206}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:206})

\par
"When it comes to media, visual imagery constructed in users' minds as a result of reading or watching a narrative is an indicator of the degree to which users are engaged in the story [26]. When technology engages users with a real-worldlike stimulus and elicits imagery engagement, it can persuade users\textemdash it enhances credibility of messages [57]; forms more confident, enduring, and resistant attitudes [25]; induces stronger beliefs and more positive attitudes about claims made on the website [17, 36]; and even leads to greater behavioral intention to actually perform the simulated behavior [54]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/210}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:210})
\par
"Cognitive engagement can be defined as the degree to which users feel attraction, curiosity, and fun during interaction. Especially, modality interactivity is said to increase the degree to which we can mentally represent the mediated information [52, 62" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/210}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:210})

"This chapter has summarized previous works regarding user engagement in communications, focusing on the importance of user engagement in the context of interactive media. The three most common, significant factors to define user engagement with media are (a) cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest in the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation of users to distribute media messages."

"The importance of user engagement with interactive media is not only limited to the area of persuasion. Psychological and behavioral aspects of user engagement with media are important for all areas that involve mediated content through technology. Future studies ought to focus on rigorously examining the effects of specific technological variables on different aspects of user engagement. For example, studies on modality interactivity could investigate how users engage cognitively as well as behaviorally with the newer interaction techniques introduced by emergent technologies such as augmented reality. Investigations into message interactivity can explore the alluring, almost addictive, power of message exchanges through multi-platform messaging applications (e.g., KakaoTalk, WhatsApp), while" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/217}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:217})

"Action and participation: Social media sites allow users to perform a variety of tasks such as viewing shared content, posting content, commenting, discussing, and collaborating. 3.

"Though the credibility of news available through social media is a source of concern [2], it serves to keep people informed of what is happening in their local community and to provide and receive first-hand accounts of events unfolding around the world [8, 31]. While most Americans prefer to get their news directly from a news organization, they are doing so via multiple sources including social media [2]. More than half of respondents to Pew's social media survey reported they obtained their news from social media sites such as Reddit and Twitter [26" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_J2LZZE24/229}{O'Brien and Cairns 2016:229})

"Interest has been typified as individual (i.e., trait-based) and situational (state-based) (Flowerday et al., 2004). Individual interest (i.e., personal interest) pertains to domain or topical dispositions, while situational interest is fostered by novel, complex, surprising, or emotionally arousing objects or activities (Silvia, 2006)."

"Previous research has demonstrated that both individual and situational interest may be present in information interactions.  O'Brien (2011)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_R8HPYEDF/1}{O'Brien and McKay 2016:1})
\par
"Interest has a complex, interdisciplinary history. There is long standing debate as to whether interest is an emotion or a non-emotional aspect of attention or motivation (Silvia, 2006), and whether it is distinct from curiosity (Silvia, 2006), choice, locus of control, and volition (Flowerday, Schraw \& Stevens, 2004).  In addition to the challenge of disentangling interest from other constructs, there is also the question of whether interest is an individual difference, or triggered by a particular situation (Flowerday et al., 2004; Silvia, 2006). What is more, how interest informs outcomes such as positive affect, engagement and learning is largely inconclusive (Flowerday et al., 2004). Interest is salient to many areas of information interaction, including online news (Arapakis et. al., 2014), social media (Berger \& Milkman, 2013), and interactive information retrieval (IIR) (Glassey \& Azzopardi, 2011; Ruthven, Ballie, \& Elsweiler, 2007; van der Sluis et al., 2014). Studies have investigated content sentiment and polarity to understand the relationship between affect, interest, enjoyment, and focused attention (Arapakis et al., 2014) or social media virality (Berger \& Milkman, 2013). The ability to monitor and support searchers' interests has implications for designing information systems (Glassey \& Azzopardi, \{This is the space reserved for copyright notices.] ASIST 2016, October 14-18, 2016, Copenhagen, Denmark.

"Arapakis et al. (2014) found that self-reported interest fostered engagement in online news interactions, and influenced readers' degree of focused attention and positive affect. McCay-Peet, Lalmas and Navalpakkum (2012) manipulated the visual saliency of task-relevant or irrelevant information to influence task performance efficiency. Yet some participants were distracted by "offtopic" content they found interesting. These studies demonstrate the role of individual differences in interest, and question the potential to evoke situational interest, on which many IIR studies may depend."

"Thus, it is unclear if interest is a product of prior knowledge or other innate factors, and if it can be engendered when IIR studies do not involve content selected by participants or informed by their prior knowledge.

  abstract = {User engagement (UE) is a quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an actor's cognitive, temporal, and/or emotional investment in an interaction with a digital system. Currently more art than science, UE has gained theoretical and methodological traction over the past decade, yet there is still a need to establish empirical links between UE and desired outcomes (e.g., learning, behavior change), and to understand the myriad user, system, contextual, and so on, factors that predict successful digital engagement. This paper focuses on the relationship between UE and media format as a potential antecedent, and the outcome of learning, operationalized as short-term knowledge retention. Participants interacted with two human-interest stories in one of four media formats: video, audio, narrative text, or transcript-style text; short-term knowledge retention was measured using post-task multiple choice and short-answer questions. It was anticipated that format would have a strong effect on UE, and that more engaged users would recall more information about the stories. However, these hypotheses were not fully supported, and the nature of the relationship between UE and learning was more nuanced than expected. This research has implications for the design of information systems and, more fundamentally, the impetus to make digital environments engaging.},

\par
"Thus, the most engaging formats (video and audio) were not the ones most conducive to KR (narrative text). This brings to mind early work that "engaging" systems may not support users' primary tasks (Chapman et al., 1999; Jacques et al., 1995; Webster \& Ho, 1997). The visually and audibly rich video may have "hooked" participants, but did not necessarily enhance their KR test performance." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_A6PZUSLP/9}{O'Brien 2017:2817})

\textbf{"The push for digital user engagement raises the question of who benefits from engagement and to what extent. For instance, what is the advantage of including "bells and whistles" in the design of a website if it does not substantially improve user experience or help users satisfy their goals? Understanding how to meet users' needs and expectations in digital environments may be paramount to the viability of some organizations with limited resources to invest in the aesthetics and interactivity of their web presence. Furthermore, the findings that UE does not always lead to knowledge retention should promote reflection on the value of engagement to individual users and society as a whole."

\par
"These attributes form the basis of theoretical models that treat UE as a process with distinct stages (point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement (O'Brien \& Toms, 2008), whereby UE attributes fluctuate according to users' changing needs and the system's ability to fulfill those needs (Jacques, 1996; O'Brien, 2016; Oh, Bellur, \& Sundar, 2015)."

\textbf{"found that aesthetic appeal and novelty predict users' levels of attention and involvement in the interaction, and perceptions of the system's usability and endurability of the experience. Endurability refers to individuals' evaluation of the system as worthwhile and rewarding, and their desire to engage with it in future or recommend it to others (O'Brien \& Toms, 2010)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_A6PZUSLP/2}{O'Brien 2017:2810})}
\par
"To date, however, most research has treated UE as an outcome in and of itself, with notable exceptions in education (Sharek, 2012; Vail, Boyer, Wiebe, \& Lester, 2015). \textbf{Search engine companies infer engagement through behavioral patterns that correspond to metrics of loyalty, activity, and popularity (Lehmann, Lalmas, Yom-Tov, \& Dupret, 2012), and the uptake of online advertising. Although monetary and usage outcomes are evident, less is known about searchers' motivations, experiences, and personal outcomes during or as a result of information interactions. Furthermore, in online searching, where millions of data points are collected and analyzed, it is difficult to ascertain what aspects of the content or system activate and maintain UE, and how these aspects interact with specific user characteristics, for example, age, cognitive ability.} Such questions may be addressed by studies that examine behavioral, physiological, and self-report data in concert (Arapakis, Lalmas, Cambazoglu, Marcos, \& Jose, 2014), but the question of what engages users is still present" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_A6PZUSLP/2}{O'Brien 2017:2810})
\par
"Several aspects of content have been investigated in conjunction with UE, including sentiment, interest, novelty (Arapakis et al., 2014; McCay-Peet et al., 2012; O'Brien, 2011), quality (Colbert \& Boodoo, 2011), and message framing (Hong, 2012). Recent research has investigated the effects of interactivity (Sundar et al., 2014) on UE, but studies examining media format are dated (Chapman et al., 1999; Jacques, Preece, \& Carey, 1995). Arapakis et al. (2014) found that content sentimentality and polarity affected UE in online news. Specifically, affect, interest ratings, enjoyment, and curiosity increased as content sentiment increased but became more negative. O'Brien (2011) concluded that novelty and participants' ability to relate personally to news content influenced story selection. Participants disengaged from online news that failed to offer anything "new" on an event or issue, that is, a "rehash" of existing information. In another news study, McCay-Peet et al. (2012) manipulated the saliency or "visual catchiness" of news items and headlines through color, size, location, or use of images. Salient, task-related information increased participants' efficiency in locating information, but personal interest in content distracted some users from their primary search task. The way in which content is presented (e.g., language, font, color) can shape users' perceptions of quality and affect behavior. Colbert and Boodoo (2011) created two versions of a bicycle repair website, "compliant" and "noncompliant." Compliancy was based on writing style," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_A6PZUSLP/2}{O'Brien 2017:2810})
\par
"phrasing and wording, text format and layout, and so on, according to published guidelines for writing online content. During a 4-week period, web traffic patterns revealed no differences in bounce rates and number of pages accessed per visit between the websites, but people spent more time on and returned more frequently to the compliant version. The analytic data suggested that the presentation of the content (e.g., presence of errors) influenced users' willingness to engage and re-engage. Hong (2012) looked at message framing, creating two versions of a health message about diet and health: promotional (e.g., "create better eyesight"), and preventive (e.g., "combat eyesight problems"). Participants were then instructed to explore promotional (e.g., "strengthen bones") and preventative (e.g., lower blood pressure) "taglines." Hong found that the initial framing of the content (promotional or preventative) was aligned with the type of tagline that participants decided to subsequently explore. There is little consensus on what constitutes "engaging design" (Koehler et al., 2005; Sutcliffe, 2009). Chapman et al. (1999) conducted two studies with one of two types of multimedia training systems: a passive video-based system and an active, computer-based system; each study presented content in audio (plus still images), video, or text (plus still images) format. They concluded that UE was more dependent on interactivity than format because participants felt more engaged with the computer-based system than the more passive, video-based system regardless of media format. Recently, Sundar et al. (2014) manipulated different modalities for navigating and accessing web content (e.g., clicking, zooming) individually and in strategic combinations. They discovered that UE was positively associated with the use of tools for accessing information (e.g., clicking), but not for navigating websites; the extensive use of navigation tools may have signaled user disorientation (Webster \& Ahuja, 2006). Sundar et al. (2014) concluded that users' initial perceptions of interactive tools shaped their experiences, and that the purpose of use (accessing vs. navigating content) should have implications for integrating new and existing interaction techniques into interface design. Their findings corroborate those of Jacques et al. (1995), who found that media preference was influenced by the nature of users' tasks (searching or browsing). However, interactive tools must be carefully considered and that, although "flashy, entertaining, and even inspirational," they may not result in the "acquisition of much knowledge or understanding" (Chapman et al., 1999, p. 3); thus, format and interactivity of media must align with the users' goals (Jacques, 1996; Webster \& Ho, 1997). However, as design is not prescriptive (Sutcliffe, 2009), designing for engagement is challenging, and users bring a variety of goals to a given system at different points in time."

"Information scientists have investigated learning in the context of information search, including the relationship between learning and search behaviors based on the cognitive complexity and type (remembering, understanding, evaluating) of search tasks performed (Jansen et al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2015). Learning is an important component of information search, but it is difficult to measure reliably and longitudinally (Freund, Kopak, \& O'Brien, 2016; Wilson \& Wilson, 2013).

\par
"topicality did matter (O'Brien, 2011). It is also interesting that media format affected the perceived usability and endurability dimensions of the UES, but that content influenced all UES dimensions. It would also be interesting to examine multiple genres, as studies have shown that "content, its presentation and the type of story being presented" (Koehler et al., 2005, p. 270) impact engagement. Online searchers encounter a range of content and media during information retrieval, and although research is exploring search engine results pages (Kelly et al., 2015) and individual documents (Freund et al., 2016), eventually researchers will want to capture the dynamic movements of searchers during web search."

"based on its presentation (e.g., small vs. large font), and Koehler et al. (2005) observed interaction effects between media format (video or text) and content genre (human interest news story, informative story, poem, and scholarly lecture). Participants who saw a video version of a poem, for example, experienced stronger emotional reactions than those who read the same poem. Recently, Oh and Sundar (2015) created an informational antismoking website, where some of the participants used a slider tool that showed the long-term effects of smoking on a person's facial features. Compared to the group who did not interact with the slider, these participants evaluated the website and its message more positively, and indicated increased levels of cognitive absorption, suggesting greater engagement. In another article, Oh et al. (2015) constructed an engagement model comprised of physical interactions with websites, interface assessments, cognitive absorption, and interactivity using a National Geographic story. They concluded, "user engagement with peripheral cues belonging to the media system or interfaces could trigger more systematic user engagement with content" (p. 19). However, in the antismoking study, the use of the slider "significantly reduced the amount of message-related thoughts after browsing" (Oh \& Sundar, 2015, p. 227), which questions whether long-term outcomes, such as avoiding cigarettes, were realized through participants' engagement with the website, and, in more general terms, whether UE with digital media mediates meaningful longitudinal outcomes. Given that previous research found effects of genre and message framing on UE, one genre, human-interest news stories, was selected for the current study to afford greater experimental control. Stories were selected that, although topically different, were similar in readability and sentimentality (see Methods: News Stories section). Thus, we did not expect differences in user engagement between the two stories." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_A6PZUSLP/3}{O'Brien 2017:2811})

"Research has also shown that user interactions with content are driven by interest. McCay-Peet, Lalmas and Navalpakkum [21] found that the visual saliency of news headlines, based on cues such as color, size, and placement on the screen, increased participants' search task efficiency, but, in some cases, participants wanted to pursue content that was personally interesting but not task relevant. Interest was also a defining component of Arapakis, Lalmas, Cambazoglu, Marcos, and Jose's [2] online news study. They analyzed 13,000 news articles to select 18 articles that varied in interest (high, low) and polarity (positive, negative) and employed these in a user study. Arapakis et al. [2] found that affect, interest, and curiosity were positively associated with sentiment, but more so when news content became more negative.

Participants were asked to indicate their posttask levels of interest and curiosity about each story, and whether they would link to additional materials on the same topic or recommend the story to others. These four items, collected after each story, were measured using a seven-point rating scale. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with approximately half (n=41) of our participants to gather their perceptions of interacting with the stories. Individuals were asked about their interaction with each story, how the format in which they interacted with the stories compared to their typical news reading behavior, and the overall quality of the news experience; probes were used to solicit elaborations on responses as needed.

"7. Conclusion Although there were non-significant different learning outcomes for participants according to the media format to which they were assigned, the stories themselves generated the most significant differences in knowledge retention scores. Interestingly, the most interesting story (farming) had lower average knowledge test scores than the less interesting, longer, and, perhaps more challenging story (mining). We suggest that participants' level of interest in story 1 affected their learning outcomes (positively and negatively), emphasizing the role of cognitive and affective responses to content in learning, and suggesting that media may be less significant in the extraction and use of information than the content itself. This has implications for the way in which content is delivered to information consumers, and suggests that the format and interactivity of media may affect user experience but not other important outcomes such as the ability to recall content."

"While we cannot control the personal characteristics that people bring to information interactions (e.g., prior knowledge, habitual interaction modes), we can focus on ways to generate situational interest during the extraction process to promote knowledge gains. Our qualitative data suggest that content factors other than media may be more influential, which bears further investigation. These findings have implications for the design of information systems. Given the differences in knowledge retention by media condition, we need to understand why participants' performance was stable for the narrative condition, but varied for the video, audio and transcript conditions. This could be achieved by measuring other content factors beyond readability (as we did in this study) and individual differences, testing active versus passive information extraction, and deploying more sophisticated measures of learning outcomes to understand the relationship between user perceptions and information complexity" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_HXK3RPCJ/8}{O'Brien et al 2017:192})

  abstract = {User engagement (UE) and its measurement have been of increasing interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more effective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and verified a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF). We employed contemporary statistical tools that were unavailable during the UES' development to re-analyze the original data, consisting of 427 and 779 valid responses across two studies, and examined new data (N=344) gathered as part of a three-year digital library project. In this paper we detail our analyses, present a revised long and short form (SF) version of the UES, and offer guidance for researchers interested in adopting the UES and UES-SF in their own studies.},

\textbf{"One approach to operationalizing the concept of UE has been to isolate user-system attributes that constitute an engaging experience.} Working in the area of educational multimedia, Jacques proposed six attributes of UE: attention (divided or focused), motivation, perception of control, needs satisfaction, perception of time ( "dragging on " or "flying by ") and positive or negative attitude ( Jacques, 1996 (p. 67); Webster and Ho distinguished attributes of engagement, such as attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest, from influences on engagement like challenge, control, feedback and variety ( Webster and Ho, 1997 in their research on presentation software" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})

"Through a systematic multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory interview study with online learners, shoppers, searchers and gamers, O Brien put forward existing and additional attributes of UE: challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect. These were mapped to a stage-based Process Model of User Engagement consisting of a point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement, where the attributes were depicted as ebbing and flowing according to the changing needs of users as they moved through dynamic digital interactions ( O Brien, 2008; O Brien and Toms, 2008 ."

"One of the aims of this work was to confirm the observations of several studies that have questioned the six original factors of the User Engagement Scale (UES) ( O Brien, 2008; O Brien and Toms, 2008 , pointing instead to a four-factor structure ( Banhawi and Ali, 2011; O Brien and Cairns, 2015; O Brien and Toms, 2013; Wiebe et al., 2014 . We reanalyzed data collected in the development of the original UES ( O Brien, 2008; O Brien and Toms, 2008 using state-of-the-art statistical techniques that were previously not widely accessible. Although the original six factors had some explanatory power, we confirmed a four-factor model. We proposed a revised UES where the items did not change, but how they were grouped as subscales was altered. The new dimensions of the UES are now aesthetic appeal, focused attention, perceived usability, and reward." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/11}{O'Brien et al 2018:38})

"H.L. O Brien et al. Int. J. Human-Computer Studies 112 (2018) 28-39 capturing subjective user engagement, some findings have questioned its effectiveness, which are reported in O Brien (2016b . Such findings may point to flaws in the UES, the ways it has been administered and analyzed in practice, or some combination of these. For instance, few researchers have used the UES in its entirety, which makes it difficult to assess its factor structure and robustness over time and across different digital applications."

"User engagement (UE) is a quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an actor s cognitive, temporal, affective and behavioural investment when interacting with a digital system ( O Brien, 2016a . Over the past two decades, the human-computer interaction (HCI) community has become increasingly interested in understanding, designing for and measuring user engagement with a host of computer-mediated health, education, gaming, social and news media, and search applications ( O Brien and Cairns, 2016" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})
\par
"Collectively this work has demonstrated that UE is highly context dependent: each digital environment features unique technological affordances that interact with users motivations to achieve some desirable end" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})

\par
"While personal goals may drive news interactions to some extent, content (and its presentation) generates situational interest, which in turn fosters engagement ( Arapakis et al., 2014; O Brien and McKay, 2016; Oh and Sundar, 2015" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})
\par
"These examples illustrate that digital environments attract users for different reasons (e.g., to learn, to share, to stay current), and seek to sustain engagement for different durations (e.g., a daily ten minute news browsing session, a ten module MOOC) to achieve specific outcomes (e.g., continued loyalty to a news provider, MOOC completion)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})
\par
"Despite the recognition that engagement is multifaceted, a persistent challenge involves understanding what aspects of users interactions with digital applications are indicative of user engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})
\par
"One approach to operationalizing the concept of UE has been to isolate user-system attributes that constitute an engaging experience. Working in the area of educational multimedia, Jacques proposed six attributes of UE: attention (divided or focused), motivation, perception of control, needs satisfaction, perception of time ( "dragging on " or "flying by ") and positive or negative attitude ( Jacques, 1996 (p. 67); Webster and Ho distinguished attributes of engagement, such as attention focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interest, from influences on engagement like challenge, control, feedback and variety ( Webster and Ho, 1997 in their research on presentation software" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})
\par
"Through a systematic multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory interview study with online learners, shoppers, searchers and gamers, O Brien put forward existing and additional attributes of UE: challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect. These were mapped to a stage-based Process Model of User Engagement consisting of a point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement, where the attributes were depicted as ebbing and flowing according to the changing needs of users as they moved through dynamic digital interactions ( O Brien, 2008; O Brien and Toms, 2008 ."

\par
"The dynamic and variable nature of computer-mediated interactions is compounded by the abstractness of UE. There is some consensus that user engagement is affective, cognitive and behavioural in nature ( O Brien, 2016a; O Brien and Toms, 2008 . This idea is drawn from 29 learning sciences research on student engagement: emotional engagement refers to the positive and negative responses students have to peers, teachers, and so on that influences their attachment to and willingness to work at school; cognitive engagement is the degree of effort students are willing to expend to master ideas and skills; and behavioural engagement involves participation in academic, social and extracurricular activities that discourages negative outcomes, such as dropping out ( Fredricks et al., 2004 (p. 58). In HCI, users have emotional reactions to the system (e.g., frustration), content (e.g., shock, interest) or other users operating within the interaction space. Cognitively, the relationship between users skills and the difficulty of the task determines the degree of mental effort required by users, and whether this results in boredom, engagement or frustration. Lastly, behavioural engagement refers to users actions, such as clicking or querying, and frequency and duration of use." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/2}{O'Brien et al 2018:29})

"The User Engagement Scale (UES) has been used widely since its publication ( O Brien and Toms, 2010a . Recently, O Brien conducted a synthesis of over forty published works that have utilized it to investigate UE in a range of digital domains: information search, online news, online video, education, and consumer applications, haptic technologies, social networking systems, and video games ( O Brien, 2016b ."

\par
"Of the studies that have used the UES in its entirety, there is strong evidence to suggest that it has four factors rather than six as originally proposed. Research conducted with Facebook users, gamers, online news browsers, and exploratory searchers has used factor or principle components analysis to analyze the UES, suggesting a four factor structure ( Banhawi and Ali, 2011; O Brien and Cairns, 2015; O Brien and Toms, 2013; Wiebe et al., 2014 . Three of the UES subscales, aesthetic appeal, focused attention, and perceived usability have been relatively stable, while the endurability, novelty and felt involvement scales have typically combined into a fourth factor. One exception to this was an analysis of webcast users engagement where there were distinct factors for aesthetic appeal, novelty, focused attention, and endurability," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/3}{O'Brien et al 2018:30})

In addition, questionnaires must be suited for populations of interest in terms of literacy levels or other developmental characteristics ( Devellis, 2003 . The UES has been developed and tested with Western adult populations in studies that evaluate digital technologies; it may not be effective in, for example, studies with children or non-digital technologies, such as print books."

"In terms of analyzing the UES or UES-SF, researchers may elect to perform factor analysis to verify the four dimensions. The use of multivariate statistics, however, must take the sample size into account, e.g., the ratio of participants to questionnaire items ( Tabachnick and Fidell, 2013 and that factor analysis or principle components analysis (PCA) can be run (e.g., type of rotation used) and interpreted (e.g., structure vs. path matrix) in different ways ( O Brien and McCay-Peet, 2017 . Further, exploratory factor analysis is a reductionist technique intended to reduce scale data, whereas confirmatory factor analysis is intended to show the reproducibility of the factor structure compared with the original." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/10}{O'Brien et al 2018:37})

The versions contained the same content, but aesthetic elements (colour, font, ads) were varied, such that one was aesthetically appealing and the other was not. The aesthetic appeal subscale failed to detect differences between these two interfaces, which was countertheoretical; the authors rightfully questioned the validity of the aesthetic appeal items."

\par
"In the case of the UES, we are not seeking to collect scores across applications for the purpose of norming, or emphatically stating what "low "or "high "engagement should look like. Rather, it is up to the researcher to determine what an adequate level of engagement with a particular application should look like. Given that the UES is multidimensional, there may be circumstances where it is more cru-" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/10}{O'Brien et al 2018:37})
\par
"For example, in one study, focused attention had a lower mean than perceived usability, and this indicated that overall focused attention was not affected by the usability of the system ( O Brien and Lebow, 2013 ." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/11}{O'Brien et al 2018:38})
\par
"One of the aims of this work was to confirm the observations of several studies that have questioned the six original factors of the User Engagement Scale (UES) ( O Brien, 2008; O Brien and Toms, 2008 , pointing instead to a four-factor structure ( Banhawi and Ali, 2011; O Brien and Cairns, 2015; O Brien and Toms, 2013; Wiebe et al., 2014 . We reanalyzed data collected in the development of the original UES ( O Brien, 2008; O Brien and Toms, 2008 using state-of-the-art statistical techniques that were previously not widely accessible. Although the original six factors had some explanatory power, we confirmed a four-factor model. We proposed a revised UES where the items did not change, but how they were grouped as subscales was altered. The new dimensions of the UES are now aesthetic appeal, focused attention, perceived usability, and reward." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_6ZC9MK3G/11}{O'Brien et al 2018:38})

"this work could be extended through experimental work that is tailored to \textbf{manipulations of specific components of engagement; for instance, only aesthetics or only the reward component}.

"User engagement (UE) is a quality of user experience (UX) that is characterized by the depth of an actor's cognitive, temporal, and/or emotional investment in an interaction with a digital system (O'Brien, 2016a). Over the past decade, UE has been investigated in a number of domains, including online news (O'Brien, 2011; O'Brien \& Cairns, 2015; O'Brien \& Lebow, 2013; Oh \& Sundar, 2015), online shopping (O'Brien, 2010; O'Brien \& Toms, 2010), exploratory search (Edwards, 2016; Edwards \& Kelly, 2016; Lalmas, O'Brien, \& Yom-Tov, 2014; O'Brien \& Toms, 2013), digital reading environments (O'Brien, Freund, \& Kopak, 2016), games (Cairns, 2016; Sharek \& Wiebe, 2015) learning systems (Sharek \& Wiebe, 2016), and advertising (Malthouse, Calder, Kim, \& Vandenbosch, 2016)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AZT4DFVQ/1}{O'Brien and McKay 2018:73})
\par
"Collectively, this research has focused on how engagement unfolds in the context of humancomputer interactions and how to measure it. These crisscrossing streams of modeling and measuring engagement have involved deconstructing UE into user- (e.g., attention, motivation, involvement, curiosity, experiential and utilitarian needs), and system-based (e.g., usability, aesthetic design, and novelty of content or design features) attributes that are believed to play a role in engaging human-computer interactions (O'Brien, 2008; O'Brien \& Cairns, 2016; O'Brien \& Toms, 2008). These attributes have led to recommendations about what makes for engaging design (Jacques, 1996; Sutcliffe, 2009) and how to subjectively and objectively evaluate UE (Lalmas, O'Brien, \& Yom-Tov, 2014; O'Brien, 2016b). While this work has ground UE theoretically and empirically, it has focused on the interaction itself, rather than the broader level of what users bring to the interaction (i.e., individual differences) and the context in which the interaction takes place (O'Brien, 2016a). Although the qualities of systems and content that facilitate or deter engagement have been investigated to some extent, there is a lack of synthesis and conclusiveness in these findings." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AZT4DFVQ/1}{O'Brien and McKay 2018:73})
\par
"Our analysis and synthesis of the literature will illustrate new directions for hypothesis development and testing, enrich our understanding of UE as a construct, and lead to new insights regarding the manifestation of UE in digital environments." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AZT4DFVQ/2}{O'Brien and McKay 2018:74})
\par
"Jacques represented UE as a continuum comprised of six attributes: attention (divided or focused), motivation, perception of control, needs satisfaction, perception of time ("dragging on" or "flying by"), and positive or negative attitude (1996, p. 67)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AZT4DFVQ/2}{O'Brien and McKay 2018:74})
\par
"' Brien (2008) proposed a Process Model of UE with four distinct stages: point of engagement, sustained engagement, disengagement, and re-engagement. Through an exploratory study, O'Brien mapped different attributes of engagement to the most salient stages of the model. For example, the aesthetics of the interface and novelty of the content were particularly important for initiating UE, while (failed) system usability brought about disengagement (O'Brien, 2008; O'Brien \& Toms, 2008)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AZT4DFVQ/2}{O'Brien and McKay 2018:74})
\par
"Webster and Ho's influences on engagement are activated during the "point of engagement" in O'Brien's model, and although O'Brien speculated that there were similar and different attributes operating during the sustained engagement phase as Jacques, she also depicted them as operating dynamically" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_AZT4DFVQ/2}{O'Brien and McKay 2018:74})

Characteristics of content that may be central to engagement include interestingness, sentiment (Arapakis, Lalmas, Cambazoglu, Marcos, \& Jose, 2014), and presentation, which can affect users' emotional response to and trust in the content (Colbert \& Boodoo, 2011)."

  abstract = {User engagement has become an important outcome measure in interactive information retrieval (IIR) research, as commercial (e.g., search engines and e-commerce companies) and educational (e.g., libraries) enterprises focus on capturing and retaining customers. User engagement pertains to the kind of investment \textendash{} emotional, cognitive, behavioural \textendash{} the user is willing to make in an application. While research has shown how characteristics of users (e.g., individual differences and preferences) and the systems and content with which they interact influence engagement, less is understood about how the tasks people perform using digital applications affect their engagement. Drawing upon a wealth of literature in IIR, this study examined the effects of task on search engagement in a within-subjects Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) experiment. Participants completed six search tasks on different task topics using task versions that included or excluded items and dimensions in the task descriptions. Items refer to things being compared (alternatives) and dimensions correspond to attributes by which items may differ. The task topics were meant to influence user interest in the task, and the versions were intended to manipulate the task doer's degree of certainty as they planned and performed the task, with the expectation that these factors would affect their self-reported engagement. We captured self-reported task perceptions (e.g., complexity, difficulty, interest) and logged search behaviours (e.g., querying, bookmarking) to both validate our manipulations and to understand how these variables related to engagement. Using multi-level modelling (MLM) we discovered that task topic affected user engagement, whereas task version had limited effects. However, participants' perceptions of the tasks as interesting, difficult, and so on affected their engagement. Through the self-report and behavioural data, we observed that effort (more search engine results page exploration, greater perceived task difficulty) had a negative effect on engagement, while bookmarking pages and the ability to understand the task and how to complete it was associated with positive engagement. These results have implications for designing search tasks, deciphering the relationship between user experience and task complexity in IIR experiments, and aligning self-reports and search behaviours in evaluating online search engagement.},

  abstract = {The content industry has been undergoing a tremendous transformation in the last two decades. We focus in this paper on recent changes in the form of social computing. Although the content industry has implemented social computing to a large extent, it has done so from a techno-centric approach in which social features are viewed as complementary rather than integral to content. This approach does not capitalize on users' social behavior in the website and does not answer the content industry's need to elicit payment from consumers. We suggest that both these objectives can be achieved by acknowledging the fusion between content and community, making the social experience central to the content website's digital business strategy. We use data from Last.fm, a site offering both music consumption and online community features. The basic use of Last.fm is free, and premium services are provided for a fixed monthly subscription fee. Although the premium services on Last.fm are mainly aimed at improving the content consumption experience, we find that willingness to pay for premium services is strongly associated with the level of community participation of the user. Drawing from the literature on levels of participation in online communities, we show that consumers' willingness to pay increases as they climb the so-called `ladder of participation' on the website. Moreover, we find that willingness to pay is more strongly linked to community participation than to the volume of content consumption. We control for self-selection bias by using propensity score matching. We extend our results by estimating a hazard model to study the effect of community activity on the time between joining the website and the subscription decision. Our results suggest that firms whose digital business models remain viable in a world of ``freemium'' will be those that take a strategic rather than techno-centric view of social media, that integrate social media into the consumption and purchase experience rather than using it merely as a substitute for offline soft marketing. We provide new evidence of the importance of fusing social computing with content delivery and, in the process, lay a foundation for a broader strategic path for the digital content industry in an age of growing user participation.},

"Rapid technology changes over the past two decades have presented the content industry with a vast number of opportunities as well as new challenges. The relative ease of digitizing text, music, and video, coupled with the ubiquity of content consumption technologies such as personal computers and MP3 players, have encouraged content providers to rely increasingly on electronic offerings, thereby reducing their production and operational costs considerably. Correspondingly, distribution costs have been lowered by the process of net-enablement\textemdash a term that refers to the incorporation of digital networks into content delivery, management, and marketing (Straub and Watson 2001; Wheeler 2002)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/2}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:2})
\par
"Indeed, consumers have largely switched to online consumption of content: Americans bought 1.27 billion digital tracks online in 2011, which accounted for more than half of all music sales (Nielsen 2012); in 2010, 59 percent of Americans consumed online news on a regular basis (Pew Research Center 2010). However, at the same time, these changes have also lowered switching costs for consumers, increased piracy, and created masses of new free content, raising a need for content providers to adopt new strategic thinking in order to sustain competitive advantage."

\par
"The recent widespread adoption of social computing marks another dramatic step in the evolution of the online content industry.2 Social computing technologies are giving rise to new forms of user interaction and cocreation; their implications for business strategy have yet to be fully elucidated. In particular, researchers and practitioners must cope with issues such as "how business can generate value through social networks, how communities in these initiatives can gain value, and how to assess the costs and benefits of social computing initiatives" (Parameswaran and Whinston 2007, p. 344)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/2}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:2})
\par
"Our results underline the importance of viewing social computing as being integral to the product strategy of content providers" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/3}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:3})
\par
"Moreover, social computing creates a shift in which computing power is transferred from organizations to individuals, empowering users with relatively low technological sophistication to use the web to "manifest their creativity, engage in social interaction, contribute their expertise, share content, collectively build new tools and disseminate information" (Parameswaran and Whinston 2007, p. 753)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/3}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:3})
\par
"The content industry in particular has been transformed by social computing technologies. The evolution of the content industry's view on social computing can be understood in light of El Sawy's (2003) three phases of IT strategy: connection, immersion, and fusion." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/3}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:3})
\par
"With the immense success of social computing, many content providers entered the immersion phase of IT strategy (El Sawy 2003; Table 1), embracing social computing features as a means of stimulating consumption of traditional content (for example, by allowing word of mouth) and prolonging users' length of stay on their websites. Users were encouraged to actively engage with the content and with one another, by posting comments, conversing on user forums, and sharing user-generated content, either within the websites themselves or through existing popular social computing platforms (Clemons 2009; e.g., many websites feature buttons, such as Facebook's "Connect" button and Google Plus's "+1" button, which enable users to share content with friends on the corresponding social computing platforms)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/3}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:3})
\par
"According to this view, content websites are inherently social, and as such they cannot separate content from social computing elements. Indeed, many contentrelated experiences are, at their core, social. People derive great pleasure from watching films together with friends, attending concerts in groups, and discussing news articles and texts in organized "knitting circles" or other informal gatherings. Thus, the offer made by the website should emphasize the social aspect of content consumption: meaning the creation and enhancement of relationships." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/4}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:4})
\par
"As content consumption becomes a social experience, value creation becomes dependent on the social environment as well. For example, users browsing the website can be informed in real time who is consuming which content or how popular different content items are. Similarly, enabling ratings and comments allows users to influence the navigation and consumption decisions of other users. Clearly, providing a platform in which users can organize discussions around different topics will inform other users, and allowing users to moderate content can improve content quality." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/4}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:4})

"Past research has investigated participation patterns in a communal setting, both offline and online. In their seminal work on learning processes in communities of practice, Lave and Wenger (1991) proposed a characterization of community behavior over time. They noted that newcomers "become more competent as they become more involved in the main processes of the particular community. They move from legitimate peripheral participation to 'full participation'" (p. 37). More" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/5}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:5})

"In a recent study, Bateman et al. (2011) offered an overarching theory: the commitment-based approach. In their study, Bateman et al. showed that users' behavior on content sites is directly linked to their commitment levels, as defined by organizational commitment theory (Meyer and Allen 1991). Content consumption was shown to be linked to continuance commitment, commitment based on the calculation of costs and benefits. The few studies that have investigated lurkers\textemdash users who strictly consume content\textemdash found that these users report mostly information benefits. If a user's total level of benefit is lower than the cost of finding the right content, he or she is likely to discontinue use of the site (Cummings et al. 2002; Nonnecke and Preece 2000)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/6}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:6})
\par
"Community participation was found to be associated with affective commitment, which is a positive emotional attachment or "feeling of belonging" to the community. In the traditional (offline) organizational commitment context, affective commitment was shown to develop through social exchanges and relationships that promote trust (Cook and Wall 1980) and feelings of being treated fairly by the community (Eisenberger et al. 1990). The practical effects of attention from the community have been demonstrated in recent research. Joyce and Kraut (2006) showed how a user's likelihood of posting is related to the properties of the replies he receives in response to his initial posting. Lampe and Johnston (2005) found that a newcomer's probability of returning to a site is affected by the ratings given to her first post. Huberman et al. (2009) showed, in the context of YouTube clips, that users whose videos attract more attention subsequently contribute greater quantities of content. Burke et al. (2009) quantitatively examined photo contributions on Facebook and found that direct feedback on content is one of the factors related to the volume of content that a user subsequently uploads."

"Linking Participation to Value Capture and Willingness to Pay" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/7}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:7})
\par
"Linking Participation to Value Capture and Willingness to Pay Value capture has proved to be challenging for the traditional online content provider. Digital content companies find it difficult to charge their consumers for access to media services, including proprietary content such as music, movies, and newspaper articles (Dyson 1995; Picard 2000). Consumers' increased tendency to seek out better prices (Shankar et al. 1999), widespread piracy (Jain 2008; Rob and Waldfogel 2006), and the introduction of digital sharing platforms (P2P) (Asvanund et al. 2004; Bhattacharjee et al. 2007) have introduced new challenges for online content retailers (see also Bhattacharjee et al. 2003; Gopal et al. 2004)."

"When content providers first adopted social computing features, they resorted to advertising as their base revenue model." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/7}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:7})
\par
"n the context of organizational commitment theory, Fullerton (2003, 2005) found that only consumers who exhibited affective commitment expressed their loyalty in the form of "willingness to pay more," while consumers who exhibited continuance commitment were not willing to pay for premium service." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/7}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:7})
\par
"community participation\textemdash will be associated with propensity to subscribe: H1: User participation in the website is positively associated with the likelihood of subscribing to premium services. The ladder of participation suggests that "higher" levels of participation will be associated with higher willingness to pay. For example, leadership roles in the community are associated with the strongest form of commitment, normative commitment, which reflects a sense of obligation to the website. Thus, our second hypothesis compares the effects of different levels of website engagement on willingness to pay. H2(a): Content organization will have a stronger association with the decision to subscribe to premium services than will content consumption. H2(b): Community participation will have a stronger association with the decision to subscribe to premium services than will content organization and content consumption. H2(c): Community leadership will have a stronger association with the decision to subscribe to premium services than will community participation, content organization, and content consumption. Nearly by definition, commitment is a long process and cannot happen overnight. Users who are climbing the ladder of participation are experimenting with new content and social activities in which they invest increasing time and effort. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that participating users will become more committed faster. In the context of content websites, this means they are likely to make the decision to subscribe to premium services sooner. Hence, our third hypothesis is H3: User participation is positively associated with a shorter period of time of free usage. As with the subscription decision (H2), we can compare the effects of different levels of participation on time to subscription. We formulate this comparison in our fourth hypothesis:" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/8}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:8})
\par
"Demographics: The age of the user is positively associated with the likelihood of subscription, but gender has no significant effect. More interestingly, the number of days since the user started using the website is found to be negatively associated with the subscription decision." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/13}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:13})
\par
"A solution to the self-selection bias is to use a proportional outcome approach. Selection bias due to correlation between the observed characteristics of a user and the user's level of social activity (his treatment level) can be addressed by using a matching technique based on propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983; for a recent use of propensity scores in the marketing context, see Aral et al. 2009; Mithas and Krishnan 2009). The fundamental problem in identifying treatment effects is one of incomplete information." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/16}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:16})

"Past research has already shown how social interactions in online environments can influence purchasing decisions (Godes and Mayzlin 2004; Huang and Chen 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/19}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:19})
\par
"This indicates that community participation can act as a catalyst for purchasing decisions in online content websites." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/19}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:19})
\par
"Second, we extend our results by using propensity score matching, a method of estimating treatment effects from nonexperimental data. Previous research on willingness to pay has used surveys or interviews in order to assess purchasing intent (Riggins 2003; Srinivasan et al. 2002; Ye et al. 2004). By using a data set of users who are currently active on the content website, we were able to study actual purchasing decisions without the biases commonly associated with surveys. The featured list of recent subscribers, updated in real time, allowed us to avoid the influences of postsubscription behavior and to properly compare a subscriber's profile to that of a nonpaying consumer." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/19}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:19})
\par
"We propose that content websites should take user participation dynamics into consideration and create platforms in which users can be encouraged to go beyond passive content consumption and climb up the ladder of participation. Such platforms should incorporate technical features that enable users to organize and curate content and form communities with fellow users, and that offer the ability to personalize the website's content and social outlook. Adopting social content as digital business strategy allows incumbents to differentiate themselves as providers of social experiences that incorporate different sets of activities and appeal to different sets of users. This would render firms less vulnerable to imitation in an age of increased competition in the content industry." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/20}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:20})

Users were encouraged to actively engage with the content and with one another, by posting comments, conversing on user forums, and sharing user-generated content, either within the websites themselves or through existing popular social computing platforms (Clemons 2009; e.g., many websites feature buttons, such as Facebook's "Connect" button and Google Plus's "+1" button, which enable users to share content with friends on the corresponding social computing platforms)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_PX3UVT8G/3}{Oestreicher-Singer and Zalmanson 2012:3})

Digital content companies find it difficult to charge their consumers for access to media services, including proprietary content such as music, movies, and newspaper articles (Dyson 1995; Picard 2000). Consumers' increased tendency to seek out better prices (Shankar et al. 1999), widespread piracy (Jain 2008; Rob and Waldfogel 2006), and the introduction of digital sharing platforms (P2P) (Asvanund et al. 2004; Bhattacharjee et al. 2007) have introduced new challenges for online content retailers (see also Bhattacharjee et al. 2003; Gopal et al. 2004)."

"community participation\textemdash will be associated with propensity to subscribe: H1: User participation in the website is positively associated with the likelihood of subscribing to premium services. The ladder of participation suggests that "higher" levels of participation will be associated with higher willingness to pay. For example, leadership roles in the community are associated with the strongest form of commitment, normative commitment, which reflects a sense of obligation to the website. Thus, our second hypothesis compares the effects of different levels of website engagement on willingness to pay. H2(a): Content organization will have a stronger association with the decision to subscribe to premium services than will content consumption. H2(b): Community participation will have a stronger association with the decision to subscribe to premium services than will content organization and content consumption. H2(c): Community leadership will have a stronger association with the decision to subscribe to premium services than will community participation, content organization, and content consumption. Nearly by definition, commitment is a long process and cannot happen overnight. Users who are climbing the ladder of participation are experimenting with new content and social activities in which they invest increasing time and effort. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that participating users will become more committed faster. In the context of content websites, this means they are likely to make the decision to subscribe to premium services sooner. Hence, our third hypothesis is H3: User participation is positively associated with a shorter period of time of free usage. As with the subscription decision (H2), we can compare the effects of different levels of participation on time to subscription.

"The content industry has been undergoing a tremendous transformation in the last two decades.  We focus in this paper on recent changes in the form of social computing.  Although the content industry has implemented social computing to a large extent, it has done so from a techno-centric approach in which social features are viewed as complementary rather than integral to content.  This approach does not capitalize on users' social behavior in the website and does not answer the content industry's need to elicit payment from consumers.  We suggest that both of these objectives can be achieved by acknowledging the fusion between content and community, making the social experience central to the content website's digital business strategy."

  abstract = {This chapter builds on previous work that positions user engagement on the user involvement continuum and suggests that user engagement is comprised of physical interactions with media, cognitive involvement, absorption in media content, and behavioral outcomes in the form of outreach or media participation. The authors explore medium or interface characteristics and individual differences in the form of ``power users'' as determinants of user engagement, and persuasion as an outcome. An empirical example is user to illustrate the relationship between physical interactions, cognitive engagement, imagery engagement, and user attitudes and behavioral intentions. The chapter acknowledges and seeks to remedy the challenge associated with integrating conceptual frameworks of user engagement into design principles.},

This chapter has summarized previous works regarding user engagement in communications, focusing on the importance of user engagement in the context of interactive media. The three most common, significant factors to define user engagement with media are (a) cognitive and emotional focus on media content; (b) attraction, curiosity, and interest in the medium or interface; and (c) voluntary participation of users to distribute media messages. Recent studies about interactive media have proposed and examined three types of interactivity that lead to these cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects of user engagement\textemdash modality, source, and message interactivity. Data from our experimental study demonstrates that user engagement indeed plays a key role in the process of persuasion involving interactive media.
\par
Source interactivity is a powerful vehicle to engage users over time when it provides them with the ability to create content and with tools that customize media use settings. Message interactivity is able to provide back-and-forth interaction tools to support user-website interaction, such as real-time chat tools or interaction history, and users are particularly engaged when the website delivers the humanness of communication through message interactivity

A conceptual framework is proposed in which engagement with a DBCI is influenced by the DBCI itself (content and delivery), the context (the setting in which the DBCI is used and the population using it) and the behaviour that the DBCI is targeting. The context and ``mechanisms of action'' may moderate the influence of the DBCI on engagement. Engagement, in turn, moderates the influence of the DBCI on those mechanisms of action. In the research literature, engagement with DBCIs has been conceptualised in terms of both experience and behaviour and sits within a complex system involving the DBCI, the context of use, the mechanisms of action of the DBCI and the target behaviour.

"This systematic review, which follows the Cochrane Collaboration's Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions [15], examines how engagement has been construed and measured in the behavioural science, computer science and human-computer interaction (HCI)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/1}{Perski et al 2017:254})
\par
"Engagement has traditionally been conceptualised differently across the behavioural science, computer science and HCI literatures, which might be due to the different epistemologies subscribed to, the differing research contexts and the different objectives pursued. In the computer science and HCI literatures, engagement has traditionally been conceptualised as the subjective experience of flow, a mental state characterised by focused attention and enjoyment [18]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/2}{Perski et al 2017:255})
\par
"This kind of conceptualisation might have emerged as a result of the focus on entertainment and usability of interactive technology. In the behavioural science literature, engagement has typically been conceptualised as Busage\^ of DBCIs, focusing on the temporal patterns (e.g. frequency, duration) and depth (e.g. use of specific intervention content) of usage [19, 20]. This kind of conceptualisation has emerged due to the observation that while many download and try DBCIs, sustained usage is typically low [21-24]. Henceforth, two working definitions of engagement as used in the computer science and HCI literatures (Bengagement as flow\^) and the behavioural science literature (Bengagement as usage\^) are used to scope the space within which this review is conducted." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/2}{Perski et al 2017:255})
\par
"A conceptual framework can been defined asBa system of concepts, assumptions, and expectations, and the presumed relationships among them\^ [27]. Previous conceptual frameworks of engagement have proposed multiple interacting factors (e.g. social support, sensory appeal, ease of use) that influence Bengagement as flow\^ orBengagement as usage\^" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/2}{Perski et al 2017:255})
\par
"28-30]; however, these frameworks are either not derived from empirical observations or draw only on literature from one of many interrelated scientific disciplines. For example, the framework proposed by O'Brien and Toms [28], notwithstanding its grounding in empirical observations, drew only on research from the technology literature and focused onBengagement as flow\^ without any links to behaviour change. Conversely, the framework by Ritterband and colleagues [29] focused onBengagement as usage\^ and was derived from behavioural science theory only. The model proposed by Short and colleagues [30] attempted to integrate both theoretical predictions and empirical findings from the behavioural science, persuasive design and technology literatures but did not do so in a systematic manner. Although the ontology of behaviour change interventions proposed by West and Michie provides a starting point for organising and representing DBCIs, engagement constitutes one of many important components and is hence not examined in detail [4]. It is therefore not possible to determine whether existing frameworks of engagement sufficiently explain real-world events, or whether important aspects are missing. The aims of this review are threefold; the second and third build on output from the first: 1. To synthesise past work on engagement, addressing the following research questions: (a) How has engagement been defined in the selected literatures? (b) How has engagement been measured? (c) What factors have been found or hypothesised to influence engagement? (d) What are the proposed relationships between engagement and intervention effectiveness? 2. To develop an integrative definition of engagement with DBCIs and specify how it can be measured. 3. To develop a conceptual framework of the direct and indirect influences on engagement with DBCIs and the proposed relationships between engagement and intervention effectiveness" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/2}{Perski et al 2017:255})
\par
"How has engagement been defined in the literature? The following two synthetic constructs were developed:Bengagement as subjective experience\^ and Bengagement as behaviour\^" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/5}{Perski et al 2017:258})
\par
"Engagement as subjective experience Engagement has been conceptualised as the subjective experience that emerges in the momentary interaction with a system [18, 28, 43]. This kind of conceptualisation was only identified in the computer science and HCI literatures. Similarities can be found between engagement and the state ofBflow\^, described as a mental state characterised by focused attention, intrinsic interest and enjoyment, balance between challenge and skill, and temporal dissociation (i.e. losing track of the passage of time) [18, 44-47]. Similarities can also be found between engagement and the state of Bimmersion\^ within digital gaming, characterised by cognitive absorption, the willingness to direct emotions towards an activity and feeling cutoff from reality [43, 48-51]. As conceptual overlap was observed between these experiential qualities, the authors propose that they can be grouped under the following cognitive and emotional states: attention, interest and affect." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/5}{Perski et al 2017:258})
\par
"Engagement as behaviour The majority of articles reviewed from the behavioural science literature conceptualised engagement in behavioural terms, suggesting that it is identical to the usage of a DBCI or its components. Engagement has further been described as the extent of usage over time [19, 52], sometimes referred to as theBdose\^ obtained by participants orBadherence\^ to an intervention [25, 53, 54], determined by assessing the following subdimensions:Bamount\^ orBbreadth\^ (i.e. the total length of each intervention contact),Bduration\^ (i.e. the period of time over which participants are exposed to an intervention),Bfrequency\^ (i.e. how often contact is made with the intervention over a specified period of time) andBdepth\^ (i.e. variety of content used) [20, 53]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/5}{Perski et al 2017:258})
\par
"In the computer science and HCI literatures, engagement has been conceptualised as the degree of involvement over a longer period of time [55], sometimes referred to asBstickiness\^ [56]. A distinction has also been made betweenBactive\^ andBpassive\^ engagement; while the former involves contributing to the intervention through posting in an online discussion forum, the latter involves reading what others have written without commenting, also known asBlurking\^ [57]. Engagement has also been conceptualised as a process of linked behaviours, suggesting that users move dynamically between stages of engagement, disengagement and re-engagement [28]. As conceptual overlap was observed between these definitions, the authors propose that engagement involves different levels of usage over time." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/5}{Perski et al 2017:258})
\par
"(1) the extent (e.g. amount, frequency, duration, depth) of usage and (2) a subjective experience characterised by attention, interest and affect\^." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/5}{Perski et al 2017:258})
\par
"Development of an integrative definition of engagement An integrative definition of engagement with DBCIs was developed through the merging of overlapping conceptualisations as outlined above, in addition to the integration of the two overarching synthetic constructs. The following two-part definition is therefore proposed: BEngagement with DBCIs is (1) the extent (e.g. amount, frequency, duration, depth) of usage and (2) a subjective experience characterised by attention, interest and affect\^. Engagement is conceptualised as a multidimensional construct: the behavioural dimensions of engagement are underpinned by the user's subjective experience of what it feels like to be engaged with a DBCI. Engagement is considered to be a dynamic process that is expected to vary both within and across individuals over time." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/5}{Perski et al 2017:258})
\par
"What factors have been hypothesised or found to influence engagement? The following two synthetic constructs were developed:Bcontext\^ andBDBCI\^. Context was subdivided intoBpopulation\^ andBsetting.\^ DBCI was subdivided intoBcontent\^ andBdelivery.\^ Relationships between constructs were specified." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/6}{Perski et al 2017:259})
\par
"Personal relevance, which refers to the extent to which a DBCI is perceived to apply to the individual and their particular situation, has been hypothesised to positively influence engagement [69, 78, 100-104]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/6}{Perski et al 2017:259})
\par
"Demographic characteristics\textemdash Age [20, 57, 63, 68-70, 73, 76, 79, 91, 95, 96, 99, 106-111], gender [20, 69, 73, 90, 95, 100, 101, 110, 111], education [20, 69, 91, 92, 96, 99, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112], employment [91, 92, 107] and ethnicity [57, 106] were found to be significantly associated with engagement. There was a trend towards a positive association between engagement and older" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/6}{Perski et al 2017:259})
\par
"Social support features, referring to features that facilitate the receipt of social support, were found to positively influence engagement [76, 82, 119-124]. Features that decrease the feeling of loneliness or that increase motivation through competition with others include online discussion forums, gamification elements such as leaderboards that show users where they rank in a gamified system, and peer-to-peer contact [125, 126]. Evidence indicates that DBCIs that provide access to such features are successful in getting users who report lower social support at baseline to engage [57, 127]; however, participants who reported higher levels of social support at baseline were found to be more likely to engage with the social elements of DBCIs across a few studies [68, 86, 91, 96" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/6}{Perski et al 2017:259})
\par
"Mode of delivery, which includes face-to-face, telephone, text message, smartphone app, website and mass media delivery, has been hypothesised to influence engagement with DBCIs [4]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"Control features, referring to features that make users feel that they are in control of and are free to make choices about how to interact with a DBCI, have been hypothesised [51, 119] or found [52, 74, 110] to positively influence engagement. For example, results from an RCT in which participants either received content all at once or sequentially over a period of weeks suggest that participants were more likely to disengage when the content was delivered sequentially [110]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"Novelty, generated by regular content updates, has been found to positively influence engagement through preventing boredom [25, 26]" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"complexity; it has been hypothesised that participants will disengage if the intervention is perceived as too long or overly complicated [26, 68, 73, 88, 131, 135, 136]. It has been hypothesised that the presence of too many features may compromise a DBCI's ease of use [19], referring to whether or not it feels natural for the user to operate an interactive system. Ease of use has been hypothesised to positively influence engagement [71, 100, 137]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"The personalisation or tailoring of content has been hypothesised [26, 52, 68, 72, 80, 103, 106, 110, 113, 119, 120, 138] or found [19, 20, 66] to positively influence engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"Interactivity, referring to a twoway flow of information between a DBCI and its user, has been hypothesised [28, 48, 50, 66, 78, 100, 139] or found [19] to positively influence engagement." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"Furthermore, challenge [61, 100, 141], aesthetics and design [120, 139, 142, 143] and credibility features [68, 73], referring to features that inculcate a feeling of trust, familiarity [97, 139, 144], and the provision of guidance or tutorials [68, 106, 145] have been hypothesised to positively influence engagement with DBCIs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"Mechanisms of action Mechanisms of action proposed to mediate the effect of engagement with DBCIs on intervention effectiveness [4] include increased knowledge, motivation, affect management, cognitive restructuring, skill building [29], comprehension and practice of programme content, and increased self-efficacy [19]. A further distinction has been made betweenBintervention receipt\^, which refers to the extent to which participants understand and can perform the skills taught, and Benactment of intervention skills\^, which refers to the extent to which participants use these skills [146, 147]. It has also been hypothesised that mechanisms of action, such as accountability to a healthcare practitioner and relatedness to other individuals, might positively influence engagement with DBCIs [68, 77, 86, 96]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})
\par
"Message tone, which refers to the terminology and wording used to communicate health messages [92, 101], and narrative [43, 50, 65, 103, 125, 140], referring to the presence of a storyline, have been hypothesised page 260 of 267 to positively influence engagement" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_WN2NS2F6/7}{Perski et al 2017:260})

\section{Information Searches That Solve Problems \textbar{} Pew Research Center}

\par
This report emerges from a national survey that looks at how people use a variety of information sources to help them address some common problems that could be related in some way to government agencies and programs. The problems about which we queried included: dealing with a serious illness or health concern; making a decision about school enrollment, financing school, or upgrading work skills; dealing with a tax matter; changing a job or starting a business; and getting information about major programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The survey's major findings:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{The internet is a go-to source.~}In general, more people turn to the internet (at home, work, libraries or other places) than any other source of information and support, including experts and family members. There was some variance in the results, depending on the type of problem people faced. Experts mattered most when people faced health problems; government agencies topped the list when information about specific programs was the concern.
\item \textbf{Searchers usually end up satisfied.~}People tended to use two or three information sources in their quest and they generally report good results, especially when they consult government agencies, librarians, and the internet.

\subsubsection{Major Questions and Findings}

\par
Americans deal with a complex array of issues and problems in their everyday lives \textendash from health care to education to employment to retirement. Many of these problems require negotiating a bewildering bunch of information sources. This report focuses on some common problems that have connections to government agencies and programs.
\par
We examine how people search for information when they face these problems and how they act on that information. Beyond that, we pay particular attention to the 36\% of Americans who have limited access to the internet. They either do not have any internet access at all (23\% of Americans), or they have no broadband at home or at work (another 13\% of Americans). This research was particularly oriented towards helping librarians and government officials learn how their institutions currently serve this ``low internet access'' population. In all, 2,796 American adults were surveyed about these issues, and an oversample of 733 ``low internet access'' respondents is part of the survey. The overall sample has a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points for the whole sample and 3 points for the low-access sample.
\par
\textbf{Question 1: What sources of information do people consult when they need to address problems?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding: More people turned to the internet than any other source of information and support, including experts, family members, government agencies, or libraries.}
\par
Respondents were asked whether they had encountered 10 possible problems in the previous two years, all of which had a potential connection to dealing with the government or seeking government information. The problems were: 1) dealing with a serious illness or health concern; 2) making a decision about school enrollment, financing school, or upgrading work skills; 3) dealing with a tax matter; 4) changing a job or starting a business; 5) getting information about Medicare, Medicaid, or food stamps; 6) getting information about Social Security or military benefits; 7) getting information about voter registration or a government policy; 8) seeking helping on a local government matter such as a traffic problem or schools; 9) becoming involved in a legal matter; and 10) becoming a citizen or helping another person with an immigration matter.
\par
Respondents often had faced multiple problems so they were instructed to focus on the most recent episode they had experienced on the list. They were then asked where they went for help and the internet topped the list:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 58\% of those who had recently experienced one of those problems said they used the internet (at home, work, a public library or some other place) to get help.
\item 53\% said they turned to professionals such as doctors, lawyers or financial experts.
\item 45\% turned to friends and family members for advice and help.
\item 36\% consult newspapers and magazines.
\item 34\% directly contacted a government office or agency.
\item 16\% consult television and radio.
\item 13\% went to the public library.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Question 2~}\textbf{: Which sources of information yield the most successful outcomes in these problem-solving searches?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding~}\textbf{: Most people were successful in getting information to help them address a problem no matter what channel they chose and no matter what problem they faced. [A table of all results on success appears on page 15 of the main report.]}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 65\% of those who approached the government for help said they were very successful.
\item 64\% of those who went to the public library were very successful.
\item 63\% of those who used the internet were very successful.

\end{itemize}

\par
The nature of the problem being solved did not much affect successful outcomes. Both simple and complex problems yielded similar results. The range for the very successful searches ran from 65\% for those trying to get further educational help to 57\% of those dealing with a health problem. All others fell in between.
\par
\textbf{Question 3: Do public libraries play special roles in people's lives as they try to solve problems?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding: Those who do turn to libraries have success, and they appreciate all the resources available at libraries, especially access to computers and the internet. And those in Generation Y (age 18-30) were the most likely to turn to libraries for problem-solving information.}
\par
Faced with a problem in the past two years that they needed to address, about one in eight adults (13\%) say they turned to their local public library for help and information. Here's why:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 65\% of adults who went to a library for problem-solving help said that access to computers, particularly the internet, was key reason they go to the library for help. And 62\% of adults who went to the library for help actually used the computers at the library.
\item 58\% of those with problems said they used library reference books.
\item 42\% of those with problems said they perused library newspapers and magazines.

\end{itemize}

\par
The problem that was most likely to be cited by those who went to libraries related to education \textendash{} either making a decision about a school, getting more training, or finding financial resources. That reason was cited by 20\% of the adults who went to libraries for help.
\par
Asked whether they would go to a library in the future to help them solve problems, 40\% of Gen Y said it was likely they would go, compared with 20\% of those over age 30.
\par
\textbf{Question 4: Who uses libraries, not just for problem solving, but for all purposes?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding~}\textbf{: 53\% of American adults report going to a local public library in the past 12 months. The profile of library users shows an economically upscale, information hungry clientele who use the library to enhance their already-rich information world. Gen Y again leads the pack again.}
\par
Public library patrons are generally younger adults, those with higher income and education levels, and those who are internet users. Parents with minor children living at home are very likely to be patrons. There are no significant differences in library usage by race and ethnicity.
\par
\textbf{Question 5: How many people have encounters with government, whether to solve problems or address other matters?}
\par
\href{http://www.pewinternet.org/2007/12/30/information-searches-that-solve-problems/}{}

\subsubsection{Major finding: More than half of Americans contacted various branches of government in the past year. The most common method of contact was visiting a government office, followed by phoning a government agency.}

\par
Some 58\% of Americans said they contacted any branch of government in the past year. Those who had contacted government were asked how they made the connection:
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 42\% said they visited a government office.
\item 29\% said they have called a government office.
\item 18\% said they have sent an email to a government office or agency.
\item 13\% say they have written a letter to the government.

\end{itemize}

\par
Contact with the government is made across various levels of administration and not concentrated at one level. Twenty-seven percent of those who had contacted government in the previous year said they contacted local government, and the same percentage said they contacted state government. Slightly fewer, 23\%, said they contacted the federal government.~ And 12\% said they reached out to several different levels of government.
\par
\textbf{Question 6: If they had a choice, how would people prefer to interact with government?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding: People's preferences for dealing with government are driven by the nature of the problem they are trying to address \textendash{} sometimes the internet is preferred; sometimes the phone; sometimes other kinds of contact such as face-to-face visits. [A full table of answers to the question on preferences is on page 9 of the main report.]}
\par
We asked respondents about six different kinds of problems or types of encounters they might have with government and how they would prefer to interact with officials if those problems emerged in their lives. It turns out that the path people would like to use depends on the kind of problem they are addressing.~~
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item If they faced a\textbf{~personal tax question,~}a majority of respondents (57\%) said they would prefer to use the phone to interact with government.
\item If they wanted to do~\textbf{research for school or work~}using government material, a substantial majority (66\%) would prefer to use the internet.
\item If they wanted to~\textbf{get a license or permit for their car,}~the majority (53\%) would opt for doing it in person at a government office.
\item If they wanted to learn about\textbf{~government benefits~}for themselves or another person, a plurality (46\%) would prefer to do so online. Some 26\% say they would use a phone and 25\% would pick a different way, such as in-person encounters.
\item If they wanted to learn about~\textbf{programs that various government agencies offer}, a majority (55\%) would prefer to use the internet.
\item If they wanted to get\textbf{~information about community matters such as education, crime or traffic~}from government sources\textbf{,~}35\% say they would pick the internet, 32\% would pick a face-to-face encounter; and 26\% would choose a phone call.

\end{itemize}

\par
\textbf{Question 7~}\textbf{: As they deal with problems, do people with limited or no access to the internet have different needs and search strategies than those who have broadband connections?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding: Those in the low-access population \textendash{} the 36\% of adults who do not use the internet or only have dial-up connections \textendash{} face health problems and matters related to government benefits at the same rate as those with high-access. But they do not face most other problems at the same level as those with high-access. The internet is not a factor in their searches and they rely more on television and radio than the high-access group. And they are less successful than those with high-access in getting the material they need.~~}
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item The low-access population is older, poorer, and less well-educated than the general population:~ 55\% of low-access group live in households earning less than \$40,000 a year, compared with 24\% of the high-access group.
\item 39\% of the low-access group is age 63 or older: only 9\% of the high-access group is in this age bracket.
\item 64\% of the low-access group has a high school education or less, compared with 33\% of the high-access group.

\end{itemize}

\par
Those in the low-access group are less likely to have interacted with government in the previous year or visited a library. Those with low-access are just as likely as those with high-access to have faced a health problem, or sought information about major government aid programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. But they are much less likely than those who have high-access to say they had job-related matters enter their lives, or face an education-related problem, or deal with a tax question, or handle an immigration matter, or seek information about a local government concern.~ They are more likely than high-access users to say they consulted TV and radio as sources of information.
\par
Those in the low-access cohort are less likely to report being very successful in their searches for help than those than those with high-access (54\% v 63\%). Broken down further within the low-access group, 61\% of those with dial-up internet access said they were very successful, compared with 50\% of those with no access at all.
\par
\textbf{Question 8~}\textbf{: Are privacy concerns a hindrance to use of government agencies, libraries, and the internet in problem solving?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding~}\textbf{: About a fifth of Americans with problems to address said they were concerned about privacy disclosures as they hunted for information. These concerns influenced the method they ultimately chose for gathering information, and they were somewhat more pronounced for the low-access group.}
\par
Some 19\% of those who faced problems said that the fear of the disclosure of personal information played at least some role in the path they chose toward information or help. Those in the low-access group were somewhat more concerned than others.
\par
\textbf{Question 9~}\textbf{: How would people like to have access to government documents?}
\par
\textbf{Major finding~}\textbf{: A plurality of Americans interviewed said that in the future, they would prefer to access government documents via the internet, but significant numbers said they would still prefer to get the printed form of government publications by mail or from government offices and libraries.}
\par
The U.S. Government Printing Office provides citizens with documents in both print and digital forms and distributes them in many different ways. Americans have an appetite for access documents through all available options: Two in five Americans (40\%) said they would prefer to get the government document on the internet, compared with 31\% who would prefer it be sent via the mail. One in five (19\%) would prefer to pick up the document at a government office and 6\% said they would go to the local public library.
\par
The low-access group more strongly favors print publications delivered in the traditional way: 46\% would like the document by mail, 25\% from the government office, 15\% on the internet and 8\% at the library.},

The interactivity and immediacy present in online news are changing the way news are being produced and exposed by media corporations. News websites have to create effective strategies to catch people's attention and attract their clicks. In this paper we investigate possible strategies used by online news corporations in the design of their news headlines. We analyze the content of 69,907 headlines produced by four major global media corporations during a minimum of eight consecutive months in 2014. In order to discover strategies that could be used to attract clicks, we extracted features from the text of the news headlines related to the sentiment polarity of the headline. We discovered that the sentiment of the headline is strongly related to the popularity of the news and also with the dynamics of the posted comments on that particular news.},

  abstract = {This article argues that as the importance of digital content to business and society grows it is important seek a holistic perspective on the definition and nature of digital content marketing (DCM). Along the journey it becomes evident that a recurrent theme in DCM is customer value, and this leads into the second major contribution of the article, an exploration of the notion of customer value in digital content marketplaces. Digital content is defined as: 'bit-based objects distributed through electronic channels'. A structured analysis is conducted on the basis of a set of questions in order to surface some of the unique characteristics of digital content marketing. The analysis is informed by a literature review, and the exploration of numerous web sites which deliver different types of digital content. The conclusion summarises the unique characteristics of digital content, and associated consequences for digital content marketing. It focuses on the impact of the difficulty in developing a notion of 'value' in the context of digital content, and its consequences for value chain structures, pricing strategies, marketing communications and branding, and licensing and digital rights management. In addition, the customer's experience of digital content is influenced by all stakeholders in the value chain as well as requiring the customer to participate in learning and co-creation of the experience. The potential of the 'value-in-use' notion of customer value as a basis for ensuring that consumers are fully engaged as stakeholders in the content economy is discussed. On this basis recommendations for practice and further research are developed.},

\emph{sum: 

We investigated the challenge of learning to recognize the degree of humor perceived for combinations of captions and cartoons. We extracted a useful set of features from linguis- tic properties of captions and the interplay between captions and pictures. We harnessed a large corpus of crowdsourced cartoon captions that were submitted to a contest hosted by the New Yorker. We developed a classifie that could pick the funnier of two captions 64\% of the time, and used it to fin the best captions, significantl reducing the load on the cartoon contest's judges 

In this paper, we describe a new direction in the realm\\
of humor recognition. We focus on the task of identifying humorous captions for cartoons. Specifically, we consider cartoons from The New Yorker magazine

The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps held data-driven humor research back. The New Yorker cartoon contest corpus is especially intriguing in this regard, as it contains thousands of captions for the same image. This allows us to analyze responses of people to the same visual stimulus, therefore enabling testing of hypotheses that would be hard to test on other corpora (e.g., joke collections). 

Our contributions are as follows: We aim to predict the relative humorousness of captions without deep image analysis and text understanding, by leveraging human tag- ging of scenes and automated analysis of linguistic features. 

To explore the linguistic properties that make a caption funny, we firs focused our attention on captions that make the same fun- damental joke 

We controlled for the length of captions given a sense that length could have a significan effec on perceived funniness of captions. We hoped that controlling for length would bring into focus other, potentially more subtle factors. 

we will only perform comparisons between captions of similar length; 

h; two differen groups of lengths were chosen in order to capture differen levels of complex- it 

Other studies of humor have asked participants to rate jokes on a Likert scale. Humor judgments have been ob- tained by averaging the assessed Likert scores. We note that there is a long-running dispute about whether it is valid to average Likert scores. For our study, we do not believe we can treat ordinal rating data as interval data. Psychological studies on subjective evaluations [31] suggest that the pair- wise setup is preferred to direct rating, and thus we chose to ask the workers for direct comparisons. 

To formulate the task as a machine learning problem, we sought features of captions that could help to distinguish between funny and less funny captions. Later, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these features. 

Table 2 shows the results. Funnier captions achieved bet- ter readability scores, but the rest of the features did not show discriminatory power. As we were comparing instances of the same conceptual joke, several of these features did not vary significantl between the alternative captions. For ex- ample, consider proper nouns: the occasional biofuel-inspired joke might mention a Prius (or give the characters a firs name), but this was a rare event. 

2.3 Summary of Results We fin strong evidence that, from a lexical perspective, funnier captions are simpler than their less funny coun- terparts \textendash{} lexically, syntactically, and using ease-of-reading metrics. There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones.

"The New Yorker holds a weekly contest in which it publishes a cartoon in need of a caption. Readers are invited to submit their sug- 150 gestions for captions. The judge selects a shortlist of the 100 funniest captions, and members of the editorial sta narrow it down to three nalists. All three nalists' captions are 50 then published in a later issue, and readers vote for their fa- 0 vorites." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_HRUX8HEN/2}{Shahaf et al 2015:1066})

"The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps heldmore data-driven humor research back.

\par
"To test our ideas, we create a dataset of crowdsourced captions from the New Yorker competition, along with human judgments. We identify and analyze dierent variations of the same joke and nd factors aecting the level of perceived humor. We also automatically identify the joke within a caption, and quantify the intensity of humor of dierent jokes and their relation to the cartoon. We formulate a pairwise evaluation task and construct a classier that, given two captions and a cartoon, determines which caption is funnier. Our classier achieves 69\% accuracy for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64\% accuracy comparing any two captions. We implement a Swisssystem tournament that ranks all captions. On average, all of the judges' top-10 captions are ranked in the top 55:8\%, thereby suggesting that the methods can be used to signi- cantly reduce the workload faced by judges. Beyond the details of the current study, we seek more broadly to frame data-centric research on humor. We wish to share directions for joining data mining with prior work on the psychology of humor for exploring an important dimension of digital content. We believe that data mining should and will be applied to psychological phenomena and that there are numerous unexplored opportunities at the intersection of these elds."

In this spirit, we used an in-house sentiment analysis tool to annotate the captions. Surprisingly, our data suggests the opposite to the finding of Mihalcea and Pulman, as funnier captions tended to be more positive (see Table 2). This find ing may be due to the crowdworkers humor preferences, the nature of the content at hand, or to the sentiment analyzer's inability to detect the subtleties of sarcasm associated with captions for the cartoons. 

We first try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline.

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

Jones et al. analyzed the components of cartoon humor and determined the effect of caption, picture, and the interaction between them on the humor rating of the whole cartoon [17]. They found that the humor of the caption was not correlated significantl with the humor rating of the entire cartoon. However, the in- teraction between picture and caption was highly correlated with the humor rating of the cartoon. Interestingly, the fun- nier the picture and the less funny the caption, the highest the cartoon was ranked. This result may be related to the finding that we presented in the previous section. \\

"Prediction Task We now show how the analyses and attributes discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, similar to the one that we presented our human judges with: given a pair of captions, identify the caption that is funnier."

"Given a pair of captions, we extract the features discussed in Section 2.2 from both. We construct a vector from both sets of features, along with the dierences between them. The label of the vector indicates whether the rst caption is funnier than the second. We perform a 5-fold cross-validation, as the size of the dataset can make 10-fold too sensitive. The split is done based on the cartoon, so the algorithm is always tested on cartoons it was not trained on. This is meant to simulate real usage by the New Yorker editor, judging captions for a new contest. Since we can make each pair of captions into a positive or a negative example (by changing the ordering), it was easy to balance the dataset, and thus the random baseline accuracy is 50\%. We rst try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline. We evaluate the importance of dierent features using the Gini importance score [6]. The Gini importance of a feature is the normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. Top features, identied by averaging across the decision trees, can be grouped into the following classes: Pronouns: you, I, it, my, we, me, your, their Question words: how, what Negation words: *n't, no, not Auxiliary verbs: do, should, need, can, (think) The result that these words were top discriminators is surprising, given that many of these words are usually considered discardable \textbackslash stopwords" (non-informative words which should be ltered out in pre-processing) in natural language analyses. Interestingly, another characteristic of humorous texts identied in [23] (in addition to negative polarization) is human-centric vocabulary, including pronouns."

We seek to better understand the nature of humorous explanations that connect the disparate frames in a surprising or interesting manner. We believe there is much to be done with extending our geometric approach to modeling distances between multiple frames.

\emph{sum: 

We investigated the challenge of learning to recognize the degree of humor perceived for combinations of captions and cartoons. We extracted a useful set of features from linguis- tic properties of captions and the interplay between captions and pictures. We harnessed a large corpus of crowdsourced cartoon captions that were submitted to a contest hosted by the New Yorker. We developed a classifie that could pick the funnier of two captions 64\% of the time, and used it to fin the best captions, significantl reducing the load on the cartoon contest's judges 

In this paper, we describe a new direction in the realm\\
of humor recognition. We focus on the task of identifying humorous captions for cartoons. Specifically, we consider cartoons from The New Yorker magazine

The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps held data-driven humor research back. The New Yorker cartoon contest corpus is especially intriguing in this regard, as it contains thousands of captions for the same image. This allows us to analyze responses of people to the same visual stimulus, therefore enabling testing of hypotheses that would be hard to test on other corpora (e.g., joke collections). 

Our contributions are as follows: We aim to predict the relative humorousness of captions without deep image analysis and text understanding, by leveraging human tag- ging of scenes and automated analysis of linguistic features. 

To explore the linguistic properties that make a caption funny, we firs focused our attention on captions that make the same fun- damental joke 

We controlled for the length of captions given a sense that length could have a significan effec on perceived funniness of captions. We hoped that controlling for length would bring into focus other, potentially more subtle factors. 

we will only perform comparisons between captions of similar length; 

h; two differen groups of lengths were chosen in order to capture differen levels of complex- it 

Other studies of humor have asked participants to rate jokes on a Likert scale. Humor judgments have been ob- tained by averaging the assessed Likert scores. We note that there is a long-running dispute about whether it is valid to average Likert scores. For our study, we do not believe we can treat ordinal rating data as interval data. Psychological studies on subjective evaluations [31] suggest that the pair- wise setup is preferred to direct rating, and thus we chose to ask the workers for direct comparisons. 

To formulate the task as a machine learning problem, we sought features of captions that could help to distinguish between funny and less funny captions. Later, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these features. 

Table 2 shows the results. Funnier captions achieved bet- ter readability scores, but the rest of the features did not show discriminatory power. As we were comparing instances of the same conceptual joke, several of these features did not vary significantl between the alternative captions. For ex- ample, consider proper nouns: the occasional biofuel-inspired joke might mention a Prius (or give the characters a firs name), but this was a rare event. 

2.3 Summary of Results We fin strong evidence that, from a lexical perspective, funnier captions are simpler than their less funny coun- terparts \textendash{} lexically, syntactically, and using ease-of-reading metrics. There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones. Other metrics, such as proper nouns and features captur- ing generality, did not achieve significan differences This might be due to comparing paraphrases of the same joke, or perhaps the size of the data set; we will return to these features in the next sections. 

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

We selected the word with the lowest perplexity (highest distinctiveness) according to the 4-gram model. If the word was a part of a phrase, we picked the whole phrase. While not perfect, this method was surprisingly accurate at findin the central joke in a caption.

"To test our ideas, we create a dataset of crowdsourced captions from the New Yorker competition, along with human judgments. We identify and analyze dierent variations of the same joke and nd factors aecting the level of perceived humor. We also automatically identify the joke within a caption, and quantify the intensity of humor of dierent jokes and their relation to the cartoon. We formulate a pairwise evaluation task and construct a classier that, given two captions and a cartoon, determines which caption is funnier. Our classier achieves 69\% accuracy for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64\% accuracy comparing any two captions. We implement a Swisssystem tournament that ranks all captions. On average, all of the judges' top-10 captions are ranked in the top 55:8\%, thereby suggesting that the methods can be used to signi- cantly reduce the workload faced by judges. Beyond the details of the current study, we seek more broadly to frame data-centric research on humor. We wish to share directions for joining data mining with prior work on the psychology of humor for exploring an important dimension of digital content. We believe that data mining should and will be applied to psychological phenomena and that there are numerous unexplored opportunities at the intersection of these elds."

"To understand what makes some captions funnier than others, we rst needed to obtain humor judgments. We recruited crowdworkers via Mechanical Turk and challenged the workers with a task of comparing the funniness of the captions.

\emph{difficulties:

We selected pairs of captions that achieved high agreement among the rankers (80\% agreement or more, similar length, ranked by at least fiv people). These pairs served as our ground truth. We had 30 batches, each one ranked by 30- 35 workers, for a total of 1016 tasks and 10,160 pairwise rankings. Only 35\% of the unique pairs that were ranked by at least fiv people achieved 80\% agreement, resulting in 754 pairs. This indicates the hardness of the task. 

found was negative orientation: a frequent use of negative words (cannot, bad, illegal, mistake) in humorous texts. In this spirit, we used an in-house sentiment analysis tool to annotate the captions. Surprisingly, our data suggests the opposite to the finding of Mihalcea and Pulman, as funnier captions tended to be more positive (see Table 2). This find ing may be due to the crowdworkers humor preferences, the nature of the content at hand, or to the sentiment analyzer's inability to detect the subtleties of sarcasm associated with captions for the cartoons. 

We first try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline.

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

Jones et al. analyzed the components of cartoon humor and determined the effect of caption, picture, and the interaction between them on the humor rating of the whole cartoon [17]. They found that the humor of the caption was not correlated significantl with the humor rating of the entire cartoon. However, the in- teraction between picture and caption was highly correlated with the humor rating of the cartoon. Interestingly, the fun- nier the picture and the less funny the caption, the highest the cartoon was ranked. This result may be related to the finding that we presented in the previous section. \\

\par
"For one set of features, we pursued the idea that captions deemed funnier might tend to employ language in a more unusual manner. In order to quantify \textbackslash unusual", we take a language-model approach. A language model is a function that species a probability measure over strings. We train" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})

"anguage models on 2GB of ClueWeb data [13], meant to represent common language. To assess dierent levels of distinctiveness, we compute four models, using 1-grams, 2- grams, 3-grams, and 4-grams respectively." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})
\par
"After computing the language models, we measure the perplexity of each caption in the context of each language model. The perplexity is the exponential of the negative average log-likelihood. In other words, the perplexity of a caption is an inverse function of how well our language model predicts it: the higher the perplexity, the more distinctive or \textbackslash stand out" the caption is." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})
\par
"Table 2 shows the results of the language model analysis. Interestingly, funnier captions tend to use less-distinctive language (recall that we are only comparing captions that tell the same joke). We note that \textbackslash keep it simple" seems to be one of the most common pieces of advice given to comedy writers, and this recommendation appears explicitly in other cartoon caption contest rules." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})
\par
"In addition to computing lexical distinctiveness, we compute the syntactic distinctiveness of funny captions. To do this, we replace each word in the captions and our web corpus by its corresponding part-of-speech (POS) tag, obtained using NLTK1 . We then learn language models and compute perplexity scores on the POS corpus." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})
\par
"Funny captions tend to have less distinct grammar on a unigram level; the results for higher n-gram models were not signicant (see Table 2). This again suggests that simpler captions are preferred by the crowdworkers who had judged the funniness of the captions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})

"Following this advice, we measure readability using Flesch reading ease [12] and Automated Readability index [27].

\par
"In a similar vein, recent work [10] postulated that movie quotes are more memorable when they can be applied in multiple dierent contexts. To obtain a proxy for the generality of a caption, we measured the number of third-person pronouns and the number of indenite vs. denite articles. Third-person pronouns refer to something that was introduced earlier, and are therefore harder to use in new contexts. Similarly, indenite articles are more likely to refer to general concepts than denite articles." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/4}{Shahaf et al 2015:1068})

"Finally, we wanted to know whether the location of the joke within the caption makes a dierence. For example, does it help to have a humorous ending, providing a surprising or witty punch line? Since we know the cluster that each caption came from, we can easily identify the location of the joke in each caption." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/4}{Shahaf et al 2015:1068})
\par
"We added four features, indicating which quarter of the caption contains the joke phrase.

There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones. Other metrics, such as proper nouns and features capturing generality, did not achieve signicant dierences. This might be due to comparing paraphrases of the same joke, or perhaps the size of the data set; we will return to these features in the next sections."\vphantom\} (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/4}{Shahaf et al 2015:1068})

"Prediction Task We now show how the analyses and attributes discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, similar to the one that we presented our human judges with: given a pair of captions, identify the caption that is funnier." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/4}{Shahaf et al 2015:1068})
\par
"Given a pair of captions, we extract the features discussed in Section 2.2 from both. We construct a vector from both sets of features, along with the dierences between them. The label of the vector indicates whether the rst caption is funnier than the second. We perform a 5-fold cross-validation, as the size of the dataset can make 10-fold too sensitive. The split is done based on the cartoon, so the algorithm is always tested on cartoons it was not trained on. This is meant to simulate real usage by the New Yorker editor, judging captions for a new contest. Since we can make each pair of captions into a positive or a negative example (by changing the ordering), it was easy to balance the dataset, and thus the random baseline accuracy is 50\%. We rst try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline. We evaluate the importance of dierent features using the Gini importance score [6]. The Gini importance of a feature is the normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. Top features, identied by averaging across the decision trees, can be grouped into the following classes: Pronouns: you, I, it, my, we, me, your, their Question words: how, what Negation words: *n't, no, not Auxiliary verbs: do, should, need, can, (think) The result that these words were top discriminators is surprising, given that many of these words are usually considered discardable \textbackslash stopwords" (non-informative words which should be ltered out in pre-processing) in natural language analyses. Interestingly, another characteristic of humorous texts identied in [23] (in addition to negative polarization) is human-centric vocabulary, including pronouns."

\emph{sum: 

We investigated the challenge of learning to recognize the degree of humor perceived for combinations of captions and cartoons. We extracted a useful set of features from linguis- tic properties of captions and the interplay between captions and pictures. We harnessed a large corpus of crowdsourced cartoon captions that were submitted to a contest hosted by the New Yorker. We developed a classifie that could pick the funnier of two captions 64\% of the time, and used it to fin the best captions, significantl reducing the load on the cartoon contest's judges 

In this paper, we describe a new direction in the realm\\
of humor recognition. We focus on the task of identifying humorous captions for cartoons. Specifically, we consider cartoons from The New Yorker magazine

The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps held data-driven humor research back. The New Yorker cartoon contest corpus is especially intriguing in this regard, as it contains thousands of captions for the same image. This allows us to analyze responses of people to the same visual stimulus, therefore enabling testing of hypotheses that would be hard to test on other corpora (e.g., joke collections). 

Our contributions are as follows: We aim to predict the relative humorousness of captions without deep image analysis and text understanding, by leveraging human tag- ging of scenes and automated analysis of linguistic features. 

To explore the linguistic properties that make a caption funny, we firs focused our attention on captions that make the same fun- damental joke 

We controlled for the length of captions given a sense that length could have a significan effec on perceived funniness of captions. We hoped that controlling for length would bring into focus other, potentially more subtle factors. 

we will only perform comparisons between captions of similar length; 

h; two differen groups of lengths were chosen in order to capture differen levels of complex- it 

Other studies of humor have asked participants to rate jokes on a Likert scale. Humor judgments have been ob- tained by averaging the assessed Likert scores. We note that there is a long-running dispute about whether it is valid to average Likert scores. For our study, we do not believe we can treat ordinal rating data as interval data. Psychological studies on subjective evaluations [31] suggest that the pair- wise setup is preferred to direct rating, and thus we chose to ask the workers for direct comparisons. 

To formulate the task as a machine learning problem, we sought features of captions that could help to distinguish between funny and less funny captions. Later, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these features. 

Table 2 shows the results. Funnier captions achieved bet- ter readability scores, but the rest of the features did not show discriminatory power. As we were comparing instances of the same conceptual joke, several of these features did not vary significantl between the alternative captions. For ex- ample, consider proper nouns: the occasional biofuel-inspired joke might mention a Prius (or give the characters a firs name), but this was a rare event. 

2.3 Summary of Results We fin strong evidence that, from a lexical perspective, funnier captions are simpler than their less funny coun- terparts \textendash{} lexically, syntactically, and using ease-of-reading metrics. There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones. Other metrics, such as proper nouns and features captur- ing generality, did not achieve significan differences This might be due to comparing paraphrases of the same joke, or perhaps the size of the data set; we will return to these features in the next sections. 

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

We selected the word with the lowest perplexity (highest distinctiveness) according to the 4-gram model. If the word was a part of a phrase, we picked the whole phrase. While not perfect, this method was surprisingly accurate at findin the central joke in a caption.

All three nalists' captions are 50 then published in a later issue, and readers vote for their fa- 0 vorites." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_Q8AEV89P/2}{Shahaf et al 2015:1066})

"The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps heldmore data-driven humor research back. The New Yorker cartoonh contest corpus is especially intriguing in this regard, as it contains thousands of captions for the same image. This allows us to analyze responses of people to the same visual stimulus, therefore enabling testing of hypotheses that would be hard to test on other corpora (e.g., joke collections)."

"To test our ideas, we create a dataset of crowdsourced captions from the New Yorker competition, along with human judgments. We identify and analyze dierent variations of the same joke and nd factors aecting the level of perceived humor. We also automatically identify the joke within a caption, and quantify the intensity of humor of dierent jokes and their relation to the cartoon. We formulate a pairwise evaluation task and construct a classier that, given two captions and a cartoon, determines which caption is funnier. Our classier achieves 69\% accuracy for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64\% accuracy comparing any two captions. We implement a Swisssystem tournament that ranks all captions. On average, all of the judges' top-10 captions are ranked in the top 55:8\%, thereby suggesting that the methods can be used to signi- cantly reduce the workload faced by judges. Beyond the details of the current study, we seek more broadly to frame data-centric research on humor. We wish to share directions for joining data mining with prior work on the psychology of humor for exploring an important dimension of digital content. We believe that data mining should and will be applied to psychological phenomena and that there are numerous unexplored opportunities at the intersection of these elds."

In this spirit, we used an in-house sentiment analysis tool to annotate the captions. Surprisingly, our data suggests the opposite to the finding of Mihalcea and Pulman, as funnier captions tended to be more positive (see Table 2). This find ing may be due to the crowdworkers humor preferences, the nature of the content at hand, or to the sentiment analyzer's inability to detect the subtleties of sarcasm associated with captions for the cartoons. 

We first try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline.

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

Jones et al. analyzed the components of cartoon humor and determined the effect of caption, picture, and the interaction between them on the humor rating of the whole cartoon [17]. They found that the humor of the caption was not correlated significantl with the humor rating of the entire cartoon. However, the in- teraction between picture and caption was highly correlated with the humor rating of the cartoon. Interestingly, the fun- nier the picture and the less funny the caption, the highest the cartoon was ranked. This result may be related to the finding that we presented in the previous section. \\

"Given a pair of captions, we extract the features discussed in Section 2.2 from both. We construct a vector from both sets of features, along with the dierences between them. The label of the vector indicates whether the rst caption is funnier than the second. We perform a 5-fold cross-validation, as the size of the dataset can make 10-fold too sensitive. The split is done based on the cartoon, so the algorithm is always tested on cartoons it was not trained on. This is meant to simulate real usage by the New Yorker editor, judging captions for a new contest. Since we can make each pair of captions into a positive or a negative example (by changing the ordering), it was easy to balance the dataset, and thus the random baseline accuracy is 50\%. We rst try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline. We evaluate the importance of dierent features using the Gini importance score [6]. The Gini importance of a feature is the normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. Top features, identied by averaging across the decision trees, can be grouped into the following classes: Pronouns: you, I, it, my, we, me, your, their Question words: how, what Negation words: *n't, no, not Auxiliary verbs: do, should, need, can, (think) The result that these words were top discriminators is surprising, given that many of these words are usually considered discardable \textbackslash stopwords" (non-informative words which should be ltered out in pre-processing) in natural language analyses.

Then, we detail the construction of a corpus where captions deemed funnier are paired with less-funny captions for the same cartoon. We analyze the caption pairs and nd signicant dierences between the funnier and less-funny captions. Next, we build a classier to identify funnier captions automatically. Given two captions and a cartoon, our classier picks the funnier one 69\% of the time for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64\% of the time for any pair of captions. Finally, we use the classier to nd the best captions and study how its predictions could be used to signicantly reduce the load on the cartoon contest's judges."

\emph{sum: 

We investigated the challenge of learning to recognize the degree of humor perceived for combinations of captions and cartoons. We extracted a useful set of features from linguitic properties of captions and the interplay between captions and pictures. We harnessed a large corpus of crowdsourced cartoon captions that were submitted to a contest hosted by the New Yorker. We developed a classifie that could pick the funnier of two captions 64\% of the time, and used it to fin the best captions, significantl reducing the load on the cartoon contest's judges 

In this paper, we describe a new direction in the realm\\
of humor recognition. We focus on the task of identifying humorous captions for cartoons. Specifically, we consider cartoons from The New Yorker magazine

The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps held data-driven humor research back. The New Yorker cartoon contest corpus is especially intriguing in this regard, as it contains thousands of captions for the same image. This allows us to analyze responses of people to the same visual stimulus, therefore enabling testing of hypotheses that would be hard to test on other corpora (e.g., joke collections). 

Our contributions are as follows: \textbf{We aim to predict the relative humorousness of captions without deep image analysis and text understanding, by leveraging human tag- ging of scenes and automated analysis of linguistic features. }

\textbf{To explore the linguistic properties that make a caption funny, we firs focused our attention on captions that make the same fun- damental joke }

We controlled for the length of captions given a sense that length could have a significan effec on perceived funniness of captions. We hoped that controlling for length would bring into focus other, potentially more subtle factors. 

we will only perform comparisons between captions of similar length; 

h; two differen groups of lengths were chosen in order to capture differen levels of complex- it 

Other studies of humor have asked participants to rate jokes on a Likert scale. Humor judgments have been ob- tained by averaging the assessed Likert scores. We note that there is a long-running dispute about whether it is valid to average Likert scores. For our study, we do not believe we can treat ordinal rating data as interval data. Psychological studies on subjective evaluations [31] suggest that the pair- wise setup is preferred to direct rating, and thus we chose to ask the workers for direct comparisons. 

To formulate the task as a machine learning problem, we sought features of captions that could help to distinguish between funny and less funny captions. Later, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these features. 

Table 2 shows the results. Funnier captions achieved bet- ter readability scores, but the rest of the features did not show discriminatory power. As we were comparing instances of the same conceptual joke, several of these features did not vary significantl between the alternative captions. For ex- ample, consider proper nouns: the occasional biofuel-inspired joke might mention a Prius (or give the characters a firs name), but this was a rare event. 

\textbf{2.3 Summary of Results We fin strong evidence that, from a lexical perspective, funnier captions are simpler than their less funny coun- terparts \textendash{} lexically, syntactically, and using ease-of-reading metrics. There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones. Other metrics, such as proper nouns and features captur- ing generality, did not achieve significan differences This might be due to comparing paraphrases of the same joke, or perhaps the size of the data set; we will return to these features in the next sections.} 

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

\textbf{We selected the word with the lowest perplexity (highest distinctiveness) according to the 4-gram model. If the word was a part of a phrase, we picked the whole phrase. While not perfect, this method was surprisingly accurate at findin the central joke in a caption.}

"To test our ideas, we create a dataset of crowdsourced captions from the New Yorker competition, along with human judgments. We identify and analyze dierent variations of the same joke and nd factors aecting the level of perceived humor. We also automatically identify the joke within a caption, and quantify the intensity of humor of dierent jokes and their relation to the cartoon. We formulate a pairwise evaluation task and construct a classier that, given two captions and a cartoon, determines which caption is funnier. Ou\textbf{r classier achieves 69\% accuracy for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64\% accuracy comparing any two captions.} We implement a Swisssystem tournament that ranks all captions. On average, all of the judges' top-10 captions are ranked in the top 55:8\%, thereby suggesting that the methods can be used to signi- cantly reduce the workload faced by judges. Beyond the details of the current study, we seek more broadly to frame data-centric research on humor.\textbf{ We wish to share directions for joining data mining with prior work on the psychology of humor for exploring an important dimension of digital content.

"To understand what makes some captions funnier than others, we rst needed to obtain humor judgments. We recruited crowdworkers via Mechanical Turk and challenged the workers with a task of comparing the funniness of the captions. The workers were presented with a cartoon and ve captions, drawn at random from the same batch. They proceeded to sort the captions from the funniest to the least funny.

\emph{difficulties:

We selected pairs of captions that achieved high agreement among the rankers (80\% agreement or more, similar length, ranked by at least fiv people). These pairs served as our ground truth. We had 30 batches, each one ranked by 30- 35 workers, for a total of 1016 tasks and 10,160 pairwise rankings. Only 35\% of the unique pairs that were ranked by at least fiv people achieved 80\% agreement, resulting in 754 pairs. This indicates the hardness of the task. 

\textbf{found was negative orientation: a frequent use of negative words (cannot, bad, illegal, mistake) in humorous texts. In this spirit, we used an in-house sentiment analysis tool to annotate the captions.} Surprisingly, our data suggests the opposite to the finding of Mihalcea and Pulman, as funnier captions tended to be more positive (see Table 2). This find ing may be due to the crowdworkers humor preferences, the nature of the content at hand, or to the sentiment analyzer's inability to detect the subtleties of sarcasm associated with captions for the cartoons. 

We first try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. \textbf{A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline.}

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

Jones et al. analyzed the components of cartoon humor and determined the effect of caption, picture, and the interaction between them on the humor rating of the whole cartoon [17]. They found that the humor of the caption was not correlated significantl with the humor rating of the entire cartoon. However, the in- teraction between picture and caption was highly correlated with the humor rating of the cartoon. Interestingly, the fun- nier the picture and the less funny the caption, the highest the cartoon was ranked. This result may be related to the finding that we presented in the previous section. \\

\par
\textbf{"After computing the language models, we measure the perplexity of each caption in the context of each language model.

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_EV2TRFTU/3}{Shahaf et al 2015:1067})
\par
"Table 2 shows the results of the language model analysis. Interestingly, funnier captions tend to use less-distinctive language (recall that we are only comparing captions that tell the same joke).\textbf{ We note that \textbackslash keep it simple" seems to be one of the most common pieces of advice given to comedy writers, and this recommendation appears explicitly in other cartoon caption contest rules}."

"Following this advice, we measure readability using Flesch reading ease [12] and Automated Readability index [27].

"In a similar vein, recent work [10] postulated that movie quotes are more memorable when they can be applied in multiple dierent contexts. To obtain a proxy for the generality of a caption, we measured the number of third-person pronouns and the number of indenite vs. denite articles. Third-person pronouns refer to something that was introduced earlier, and are therefore harder to use in new contexts. Similarly, indenite articles are more likely to refer to general concepts than denite articles." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_EV2TRFTU/4}{Shahaf et al 2015:1068})

"Finally, we wanted to know whether the location of the joke within the caption makes a dierence. For example, does it help to have a humorous ending, providing a surprising or witty punch line?

The label of the vector indicates whether the rst caption is funnier than the second. We perform a 5-fold cross-validation, as the size of the dataset can make 10-fold too sensitive. The split is done based on the cartoon, so the algorithm is always tested on cartoons it was not trained on. This is meant to simulate real usage by the New Yorker editor, judging captions for a new contest. Since we can make each pair of captions into a positive or a negative example (by changing the ordering), it was easy to balance the dataset, and thus the random baseline accuracy is 50\%. We rst try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. \textbf{That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone}. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline. We evaluate the importance of dierent features using the Gini importance score [6]. The Gini importance of a feature is the normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. Top features, identied by averaging across the decision trees, can be grouped into the following classes: Pronouns: you, I, it, my, we, me, your, their Question words: how, what Negation words: *n't, no, not Auxiliary verbs: do, should, need, can, (think) The result that these words were top discriminators is surprising, given that many of these words are usually considered discardable \textbackslash stopwords" (non-informative words which should be ltered out in pre-processing) in natural language analyses. Interestingly, another characteristic of humorous texts identied in [23] (in addition to negative polarization) is human-centric vocabulary, including pronouns."

While funnier captions still have simpler grammatical structure, it now seems like they use more distinctive vocabulary.

\emph{sum: 

We investigated the challenge of learning to recognize the degree of humor perceived for combinations of captions and cartoons. We extracted a useful set of features from linguis- tic properties of captions and the interplay between captions and pictures. We harnessed a large corpus of crowdsourced cartoon captions that were submitted to a contest hosted by the New Yorker. We developed a classifie that could pick the funnier of two captions 64\% of the time, and used it to fin the best captions, significantl reducing the load on the cartoon contest's judges 

In this paper, we describe a new direction in the realm\\
of humor recognition. We focus on the task of identifying humorous captions for cartoons. Specifically, we consider cartoons from The New Yorker magazine

The absence of large humor corpora has perhaps held data-driven humor research back. The New Yorker cartoon contest corpus is especially intriguing in this regard, as it contains thousands of captions for the same image. This allows us to analyze responses of people to the same visual stimulus, therefore enabling testing of hypotheses that would be hard to test on other corpora (e.g., joke collections). 

Our contributions are as follows: We aim to predict the relative humorousness of captions without deep image analysis and text understanding, by leveraging human tag- ging of scenes and automated analysis of linguistic features. 

To explore the linguistic properties that make a caption funny, we firs focused our attention on captions that make the same fun- damental joke 

We controlled for the length of captions given a sense that length could have a significan effec on perceived funniness of captions. We hoped that controlling for length would bring into focus other, potentially more subtle factors. 

we will only perform comparisons between captions of similar length; 

h; two differen groups of lengths were chosen in order to capture differen levels of complex- it 

Other studies of humor have asked participants to rate jokes on a Likert scale. Humor judgments have been ob- tained by averaging the assessed Likert scores. We note that there is a long-running dispute about whether it is valid to average Likert scores. For our study, we do not believe we can treat ordinal rating data as interval data. Psychological studies on subjective evaluations [31] suggest that the pair- wise setup is preferred to direct rating, and thus we chose to ask the workers for direct comparisons. 

To formulate the task as a machine learning problem, we sought features of captions that could help to distinguish between funny and less funny captions. Later, we evaluate and compare the predictive power of these features. 

Table 2 shows the results. Funnier captions achieved bet- ter readability scores, but the rest of the features did not show discriminatory power. As we were comparing instances of the same conceptual joke, several of these features did not vary significantl between the alternative captions. For ex- ample, consider proper nouns: the occasional biofuel-inspired joke might mention a Prius (or give the characters a firs name), but this was a rare event. 

2.3 Summary of Results We fin strong evidence that, from a lexical perspective, funnier captions are simpler than their less funny coun- terparts \textendash{} lexically, syntactically, and using ease-of-reading metrics. There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones. Other metrics, such as proper nouns and features captur- ing generality, did not achieve significan differences This might be due to comparing paraphrases of the same joke, or perhaps the size of the data set; we will return to these features in the next sections. 

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

We selected the word with the lowest perplexity (highest distinctiveness) according to the 4-gram model. If the word was a part of a phrase, we picked the whole phrase. While not perfect, this method was surprisingly accurate at findin the central joke in a caption.

"To test our ideas, we create a dataset of crowdsourced captions from the New Yorker competition, along with human judgments. We identify and analyze dierent variations of the same joke and nd factors aecting the level of perceived humor. We also automatically identify the joke within a caption, and quantify the intensity of humor of dierent jokes and their relation to the cartoon. We formulate a pairwise evaluation task and construct a classier that, given two captions and a cartoon, determines which caption is funnier. Our classier achieves 69\% accuracy for captions hinging on the same joke, and 64\% accuracy comparing any two captions. We implement a Swisssystem tournament that ranks all captions. On average, all of the judges' top-10 captions are ranked in the top 55:8\%, thereby suggesting that the methods can be used to signi- cantly reduce the workload faced by judges. Beyond the details of the current study, we seek more broadly to frame data-centric research on humor. We wish to share directions for joining data mining with prior work on the psychology of humor for exploring an important dimension of digital content. We believe that data mining should and will be applied to psychological phenomena and that there are numerous unexplored opportunities at the intersection of these elds."

found was negative orientation: a frequent use of negative words (cannot, bad, illegal, mistake) in humorous texts. In this spirit, we used an in-house sentiment analysis tool to annotate the captions. Surprisingly, our data suggests the opposite to the finding of Mihalcea and Pulman, as funnier captions tended to be more positive (see Table 2). This find ing may be due to the crowdworkers humor preferences, the nature of the content at hand, or to the sentiment analyzer's inability to detect the subtleties of sarcasm associated with captions for the cartoons. 

We first try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline.

For a cartoon to be funny, the reader needs to understand both the picture and the cap- tion, and then to integrate them into a meaningful whole. 

Jones et al. analyzed the components of cartoon humor and determined the effect of caption, picture, and the interaction between them on the humor rating of the whole cartoon [17]. They found that the humor of the caption was not correlated significantl with the humor rating of the entire cartoon. However, the in- teraction between picture and caption was highly correlated with the humor rating of the cartoon. Interestingly, the fun- nier the picture and the less funny the caption, the highest the cartoon was ranked. This result may be related to the finding that we presented in the previous section. \\

To obtain a proxy for the generality of a caption, we measured the number of third-person pronouns and the number of indenite vs. denite articles. Third-person pronouns refer to something that was introduced earlier, and are therefore harder to use in new contexts.

There is some evidence that less funny captions present the core joke earlier in the caption than funnier ones. Other metrics, such as proper nouns and features capturing generality, did not achieve signicant dierences.

"Prediction Task We now show how the analyses and attributes discussed above can provide features for a basic prediction task, similar to the one that we presented our human judges with: given a pair of captions, identify the caption that is funnier."

\par
"Given a pair of captions, we extract the features discussed in Section 2.2 from both. We construct a vector from both sets of features, along with the dierences between them. The label of the vector indicates whether the rst caption is funnier than the second. We perform a 5-fold cross-validation, as the size of the dataset can make 10-fold too sensitive. The split is done based on the cartoon, so the algorithm is always tested on cartoons it was not trained on. This is meant to simulate real usage by the New Yorker editor, judging captions for a new contest. Since we can make each pair of captions into a positive or a negative example (by changing the ordering), it was easy to balance the dataset, and thus the random baseline accuracy is 50\%. We rst try to predict the funnier caption using a standard bag-of-words model. That is, we try to predict which caption is funnier based on content alone. A random forest using only bag-of-words features achieves 52\% accuracy, only slightly outperforming the random baseline. We evaluate the importance of dierent features using the Gini importance score [6]. The Gini importance of a feature is the normalized total reduction of the criterion brought by that feature. Top features, identied by averaging across the decision trees, can be grouped into the following classes: Pronouns: you, I, it, my, we, me, your, their Question words: how, what Negation words: *n't, no, not Auxiliary verbs: do, should, need, can, (think) The result that these words were top discriminators is surprising, given that many of these words are usually considered discardable \textbackslash stopwords" (non-informative words which should be ltered out in pre-processing) in natural language analyses. Interestingly, another characteristic of humorous texts identied in [23] (in addition to negative polarization) is human-centric vocabulary, including pronouns."

"Also, we note that no explicit joke words achieved high importance as discriminators, most likely because we compare captions that tell the same joke.

This research studied the relationship of these three variables and identified critical factors related to them. The participants were 48 graduate students who took a blended-format course in health education and worked on a collaborative group project related to the development of a comprehensive HIV-AIDS prevention plan. Data was collected from the Student Perception Questionnaire and face-to-face interviews. The analysis of quantitative data indicated that student perceptions of collaborative learning have statistically positive relationships with perceptions of social presence and satisfaction. This means that students who perceived high levels of collaborative learning tended to be more satisfied with their distance course than those who perceived low levels of collaborative learning. Similarly, students with high perceptions of collaborative learning perceived high levels of social presence as well. Surprisingly, the relationship between social presence and overall satisfaction was positive but not statistically significant. Interview data revealed that (a) course structure, (b) emotional support, and (c) communication medium were critical factors associated with student perceptions of collaborative learning, social presence, and satisfaction. Explanations about findings and implications for instructional design are discussed in the conclusion.},

Qualitative research is used to identify important factors that appear to influence perceptions of home page complexity, including home page length, number of graphics, number of links, amount of text, and use of animation. A pretest experiment further aided in the selection of appropriate factors and factor levels to manipulate in a subsequent, main experiment.

"Abstract Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop a research model that examines the effect of information overload and information disorganisation upon customers' perceived risk and purchase intention online in a single integrative model. In addition the paper investigates whether internet experience moderates these relationships. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the paper's objectives an experiment that involved visiting the ten most visited e-commerce web sites in Spain was conducted. Hypotheses were tested by using structural equation modelling on a data set of 1,396 online shopping customers. Findings - The results suggest a positive relationship between information overload and customer purchase intention and that internet experience reinforces this positive effect. Moreover the results confirm that the relationship between information disorganisation and customer purchase intention is not significant and that internet experience does not moderate the relationship. The findings also indicate that perceived risk mediates the relationship between information overload and information disorganisation on customer purchase intention. Originality/value - This work contributes to the literature by exploring the phenomenon of information overload and information disorganisation upon customers' perceived risk and purchase intention in the e-commerce environment as well as the moderating effect of internet experience on these relationships in a single integrative model. The main conclusions of this investigation can be valuable to organisations that implement or intend to implement e-commerce.

"Academics and practitioners widely acknowledge that conducting transactions through a virtual medium is radically different from shopping offline (Molina-Castillo et al., 2012)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KZLN367W/2}{Soto-Acosta et al 2014:544})

"and customers have more control over the information they seek (Vila and Kurster, 2011). Nonetheless the internet's ability to host large amounts of information may produce information overload and affect consumer behaviour (Gurrea et al., 2013; Zha et al., 2013). This phenomenon occurs when consumers are provided with too much information in a limited amount of time, such that it exceeds their processing limits (Eppler and Mengis, 2004; Jackson and Farzaneh, 2012). The problem of information overload is a significant one for contemporary knowledge-intensive organisations as well because it can adversely affect productivity, decision making, and employee morale (Whelan and Teigland, 2013). A large number of studies have analysed the relationships between information overload, information processing, and decision quality at the individual level. Inconsistent results in the above-mentioned relationships have been found when consumers are conducting their purchases online. Several studies (e.g. Chen et al., 2009; Sicilia and Ruiz, 2010) found negative effects from online information overload, while others (e.g. Huang, 2000; Huang et al., 2013) obtained opposite results. These inconsistent findings have been attributed to different operationalisations of information overload and also to the choice of decision quality as the dependent variable (Chen et al., 2009). In addition conclusions regarding information overload in traditional stores may not be extrapolated to the online medium and this issue requires further research." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KZLN367W/3}{Soto-Acosta et al 2014:545})
\par
"Another issue that may have major effects on consumer behaviour is the organisation of the information display (De Andres et al., 2010). How the information is structured or organised on the web site may determine its success (Lurie, 2004), since disorientation is the most common navigation problem in hypertext systems (Ruttun and Macredie, 2012) and may cause cognitive overload. Hypertext creates a web of connections and offers a very powerful way of organising and accessing a large body of information. Although text readers use their whole cognitive ability to understand information, web readers need to use their cognitive ability not only for that but also to make decisions regarding the navigation of the web (Yu and Roh, 2002). Moreover excessive search complexity makes it difficult for customers to locate the needed information, thus negatively affecting customers' decision quality (Zha et al., 2013)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KZLN367W/3}{Soto-Acosta et al 2014:545})

"Our study lies in the last process of information management: information dissemination. More specifically it assesses the effect of information overload and information disorganisation upon perceived risk and consumers' purchase intention to buy a product via the internet. The following subsections emphasise specific literature on this subject and develop the research hypotheses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KZLN367W/4}{Soto-Acosta et al 2014:546})
\par
"Another theoretical framework used in this paper is Vessey's (1994) cognitive fit theory. According to this perspective, how the information is presented to an individual will affect their performance in a given task and their decision making (Vessey, 1994). In an online context the final decision to be made deals with the purchase of products or services. This study analyses the effect of two features of information presentation (information overload and information disorganisation) on online purchase intention."

\par
"Although there is no universally agreed definition of information overload (Jackson and Farzaneh, 2012), we agree with the literature that it usually refers to the notion of receiving too much information at any given time such that it exceeds the processing limits (Eppler and Mengis, 2004; Jackson and Farzaneh, 2012; Whelan and Teigland, 2013). The relationship between information load and information processing is usually described as an inverted U curve. That is, information processing increases when the decision maker is subjected to information underload, while it decreases when they are experiencing information overload (Jacoby et al., 1974). Since decision quality is positively associated with information processing, the relationship between information load and decision quality has been considered as an inverted U curve as well. However, several studies have produced mixed results regarding the effects of information load and decision quality" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KZLN367W/4}{Soto-Acosta et al 2014:546})
\par
"How the information is structured on the web site is another important issue when 546 selling products or services online. In contrast to offline customers, online customers use their cognitive ability not only to understand information but also to navigate through the web (Yu and Roh, 2002). Therefore, although how the information is organised on the web site is independent from its meaning, it has important implications for information processing which, in turn, may influence decision quality (Lurie, 2004)."

"Internet experience Internet experience is defined as the consumer's skill or ability obtained by visiting several web sites and using various value-added services offered on a broad range of web sites, and not as experience with one particular web site (Nysveen and Pedersen, 2004). Consumers' experience with the internet is important in understanding customers' perceptions, attitudes, and behaviour in online environments. Specifically internet experience contributes to more effective use of web site applications in such a way that experienced internet users have more positive attitudes to using a web site (Chen and Macredie, 2005). Many marketers believe that experience gained through simple usage of the internet for non-purchase purposes such as information gathering and non-commercial communication will lead consumers to discover that privacy and security risks are often exaggerated. It has been found that the more frequently a consumer uses the internet, the more knowledgeable they are about using the internet and the consumer feels less risk associated with the internet (Chen and He, 2003). Lpez-Nicols and Molina-Castillo (2008) found that internet experience reduces the risk perceived by online consumers and increases their internet preference, suggesting that people skilled at using the internet enjoy exploring web sites while their attitudes towards them are improved (Chen and He, 2003)."

"Huang (2000) identified two dimensions of information load: novelty and complexity.

"Previous literature in conventional retail environments found inconsistent results for the relationship between the amount of information and decision quality. Initial research confirmed an inverted U relationship (Jacoby et al., 1974; Scammon, 1977), while later studies found no decrease in decision quality as the information load increased (Keller and Staelin, 1989; Muller, 1984). These inconsistent findings have been attributed to different operationalisations of information overload (Chen et al., 2009) and to the fact that they did not consider context factors. With regard to the internet medium, although several studies suggested that information overload may encourage online transactions (Huang, 2000; Huang et al., 2013), the majority of research found that an excess of information results in a lack of attention towards purchasing online (e.g. Chen et al., 2009; Sicilia and Ruiz, 2010) and that online experience reduces information overload (Chen et al., 2009). Our findings suggest a positive relationship between information overload and customer purchase intention. This is in line with the expectations of Huang (2000)."

"and sellers have no face-to-face contact, providing rich information represents an important signal, which in turn has a direct relationship with customers' purchase intention. Moreover internet experience is found to reinforce the positive effect of information overload on customer purchase intention, which is consistent with the literature.

"The internet's ability to host large amounts of information may produce information overload and affect consumer behaviour. Inconsistent results for information overload and decision making have been found in traditional shopping and also when purchasing online (Sicilia and Ruiz, 2010).

Building on psychological motivation theory, the authors examine key differences in B2B and B2C social media message strategies in terms of branding, message appeals, selling, and information search. Using Bayesian models, they find noteworthy differences in the propensity of viewers to popularize brand posts. Specifically, the results indicate that the inclusion of corporate brand names, functional and emotional appeals, and information search cues increases the popularity of B2B messages compared with B2C messages. Moreover, viewers of B2B content demonstrate a higher message liking rate but a lower message commenting rate than viewers of B2C content.},

In the case of Digg, measuring access to given stories during the first two hours allows us to forecast their popularity 30 days ahead with remarkable accuracy, while downloads of Youtube videos need to be followed for 10 days to attain the same performance. The differing time scales of the predictions are shown to be due to differences in how content is consumed on the two portals: Digg stories quickly become outdated, while Youtube videos are still found long after they are initially submitted to the portal. We show that predictions are more accurate for submissions for which attention decays quickly, whereas predictions for evergreen content will be prone to larger errors.},

"Explanations and predictions of people's choices, in everyday life as well as in the social sciences, are often founded on the assumption of human rationality. The definition of rationality has been much debated, but there is general agreement that rational choices should satisfy some elementary requirements of consistency and coherence. In this article tional choice requires that the preference between options should not reverse with changes of frame. Because of imperfections of human perception and decision, however, changes of perspective often reverse the relative apparent size of objects and the relative desirability of options."

"A decision problem is defined by the acts or options among which one must choose, the possible outcomes or consequences of these acts, and the contingencies or conditional probabilities that relate outcomes to acts. We use the term "decision frame" to refer to the decision-maker's conception of the acts, outcornes, and contingencies associated with a particular choice. The frame that a decision-maker adopts is controlled partly by the formulation of the problem and partly by the norms, habits, and personal characteristics of the decision-maker. It is often possible to frame a given decision problem in more than one way. Alternative frames for a decision prob lenz may be compared to alternative perspectives on a visual scene. Veridical perception requires that the perceived relative height of two neighboring mountains, say, should not reverse with changes of vantage point. Similarly, raSCIENCE, VOL. 211, 30 JANUARY 1981 sals of preference by variations in the framing of acts, contingencies, or outcomes. These effects have been observed in a variety of problems and in the choices of different groups of respondents. Here we present selected illustrations of preference reversals, with data obtained from students at Stanford University and at the University of British Columbia who answered brief questionnaires in a classroom setting. The total number of respondents for each problem is denoted by N, and the percentage who chose each option is indicated in bracke" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:454})
\par
"The majority choice in problem 2 is risk taking: the certain death of 400 people is less acceptable than the two-inthree chance that 600 will die. The preferences in problems 1 and 2 illustrate a common pattern: choices involving gains are often risk averse and choices involving losses are often risk taking. However, it is easy to see that the two problems are effectively identical. The only difference between them is that the outcomes are described in problem 1 by the number of lives saved and in problem 2 by the number of lives lost. The change is accompanied by a pronvunced shift from risk aversion to risk taking. We have observed this reversal in several groups of respondents, including university faculty and physicians. Inconsistent responses to problems 1 and 2 arise from the conjunction of a framing effect with contradictory attitudes toward risks involving gains and losses. We turn now to an analysis of these attitudes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:454})
\par
"The Evaluation of Prospects The major theory of decision-making under risk is the expected utility model. This model is based on a set of axioms, for example, transitivity of preferences, which provide criteria for the rationality of choices. The choices of an individual who conforms to the axioms can be described in terms of the utilities of various outcomes for that individual. The utility of a risky prospect is equal to the expected utility of its outcomes, obtained by weighting the utility of each possible outcome by its probability. When faced with a choice, a rational decision-maker will prefer the prospect that offers the highest expected utility (1, 2" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:454})

"The Framing of Outcomes Outcomes are commonly perceived as positive or negative in relation to a reference outcome that is judged neutral. Variations of the reference point can" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/5}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:457})
\par
"These observations highlight the lability of reference outcomes, as well as their role in decision-making. In the examples discussed so far, the neutral reference point was identified by the labeling of outcomes. A diversity of factors determine the reference outcome in everyday life. The reference outcome is usually a state to which one has adapted; it is sometimes set by social norms and expectations; it sometimes corresponds to a level of aspiration, which may or may not be realistic. We have dealt so far with elementary outcomes, such as gains or losses in a single attribute. In many situations, however, an action gives rise to a compound outcome, which joins a series of changes in a single attribute, such as a sequence of monetary gains and losses, or a set of concurrent changes in several attributes. To describe the framing and evaluation of compound outcomes, we use the notion of a psychological account, defined as an outcome frame which specifies (i) the set of elementary outcomes that are evaluated jointly and the manner in which they are combined and (ii) a reference outcome that is considered neutral or normal. In the account that is set up for the purchase of a car, for example, the cost of the purchase is not treated as a loss nor is the car viewed as a gift. Rather, the transaction as a whole is evaluated as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on such factors as the performance of the car and the price of similar cars in the market. A closely related treatment has been offered by Thaler (18)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/5}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:457})

"Discussion In this article we have presented a series of demonstrations in which seemingly inconsequential changes in the formuiation of choice problems caused significant shifts of preference" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:458})
\par
"consistencies were traced to the interaction of two sets of factors: variations in the framing of acts, contingencies, and outcomes, and the characteristic nonlinearities of values and decision weights. The demonstrated effects are large' and systematic, although by no means universal. They occur when the outcomes concern the loss of human lives as well as in choices about money; they are not restricted to hypothetical questions and are not eliminated by monetary incentives." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:458})
\par
"The metaphor of changing perspective can be applied to other phenomena of choice, in addition to the framing effects with which we have been concerned here (19). The problem of self-control is naturally construed in these terms. The story of Ulysses' request to be bound to the mast of the ship in anticipation of the irresistible temptation of the Sirens' call is o'ften used as a paradigm case (22). In this example of precommitment, an action taken in the present renders inoperative an anticipated future preference. An unusual feature of the problem of intertemporal conflict is that the agent who views a problem from a particular temporal perspective is also aware of the conflicting views that future perspectives will offer. In most other situations, decision-makers are not normally aware of the potential effects of different decision' frames on their preferences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:458})
\par
"The perspective metaphor highlights the following aspects of the psychology of choice. Individuals who face a decision problem and have a definite preference (i) might have a different preference in a different framing of the same problem, (ii) are normally unaware of alternative frames and of their potential effects on the relative attractiveness of options," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:458})
\par
"(iii) would wish their preferences to be independent of frame, but (iv) are often uncertain how to resolve detected incon-; sistencies (23). In some cases (such as problems 3 and 4 and perhaps problems 8 and 9) the advantage of one frame becomes evident once the competing frames are compared, but in other cases- (problems 1 and 2 and problems 6 and 7) it is not obvious which preferences should be abandoned" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:459})
\par
"The present work has been concerned primarily with the descriptive question of how decisions are made, but the psychology of choice is aiso relevant to the normative question of how decisions ought to be made. In order to avoid the difficult problem of justifying values, the modern theory of rational choice has adopted the coherence of specific preferences as the sole criterion of rationality. This approach enjoins the decisionnzaker to resolve inconsistencies but offers no guidaxlce on how to do so. It implicitly assumes that the decisionmaker who carefully answers the questio ';What do I really want?" will eventually achieve coherent preferences. However, the susceptibility of preforences to variations of framing raises doubt about the feasibility and adequacy of the coherence criterion" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:459})
\par
"Consistency is only one aspect of the lay notion of rational behavior. As noted by March (?6), the common conception of rationality also requires that preferences or utilities for particular outcomes should be predictive of the experiences of satisfaction or displeasure associated with their occurrence. Thus, a man could be judged irratioIlal either because his preferences are contradictory or because his desires and aversions do not reflect his pleasures and pains. The-predictive criterion of rationality can be applied to resolve inconsistent preferences and to improve the quality of decisions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:459})

"Further complexities arise in the normative analysis because the framing of an action sometimes affects the actual experience of its outomes. For example, framing outcomes in terms of overall wealth or welfare rather than in terms of specific gains and losses may attenuate one's emotional response to an occasional loss. Similarly, the experience of a change for the worse may vary if the change is framed as an uncompensated loss or as a cost incurred to achieve some benefit. The framing of acts and outcomes can also reflect the acceptance or rejection of responsibility for particular consequences, and the deliberate manipulation of framing is commonly used as an instxument of selfcontrol (22 ). When framing influences the experience of consequences, the adoption of a decision frame is an ethically significant act." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1981:459})

"The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of ChoiceAmos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:108})
\par
"Explanations and predictions of people's choices, in everyday life as well as in the social sciences, are often founded on the assumption of human rationality. The definition of rationality has been much debated, but there is general agreement that rational choices should satisfy some elementary requirements of consistency and coherence. In this article tional choice requires that the preference between options should not reverse with changes of frame. Because of imperfections of human perception and decision, however, changes of perspective often reverse the relative apparent size of objects and the relative desirability of options." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:108})
\par
". The psychological principles that govern the perception of decision problems and the evaluation of probabilities and outcomes produce predictable shifts of preference when the same problem is framed in different ways. Reversals of preference are demonstrated in choices regarding monetary outcomes, both hypothetical and real, and in questions pertaining to the loss of human lives. The effects of frames on preferences are compared to the effects of perspectives on perceptual appearance. The dependence of preferences on the formulation of decision problems is a significant concern for the theory of rational choice." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:108})
\par
"A decision problem is defined by the acts or options among which one must choose, the possible outcomes or consequences of these acts, and the contingencies or conditional probabilities that relate outcomes to acts. We use the term "decision frame" to refer to the decision-maker's conception of the acts, outcornes, and contingencies associated with a particular choice. The frame that a decision-maker adopts is controlled partly by the formulation of the problem and partly by the norms, habits, and personal characteristics of the decision-maker. It is often possible to frame a given decision problem in more than one way. Alternative frames for a decision prob lenz may be compared to alternative perspectives on a visual scene. Veridical perception requires that the perceived relative height of two neighboring mountains, say, should not reverse with changes of vantage point. Similarly, raSCIENCE, VOL. 211, 30 JANUARY 1981 sals of preference by variations in the framing of acts, contingencies, or outcomes. These effects have been observed in a variety of problems and in the choices of different groups of respondents. Here we present selected illustrations of preference reversals, with data obtained from students at Stanford University and at the University of British Columbia who answered brief questionnaires in a classroom setting. The total number of respondents for each problem is denoted by N, and the percentage who chose each option is indicated in bracke" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:108})
\par
"The majority choice in problem 2 is risk taking: the certain death of 400 people is less acceptable than the two-inthree chance that 600 will die. The preferences in problems 1 and 2 illustrate a common pattern: choices involving gains are often risk averse and choices involving losses are often risk taking. However, it is easy to see that the two problems are effectively identical. The only difference between them is that the outcomes are described in problem 1 by the number of lives saved and in problem 2 by the number of lives lost. The change is accompanied by a pronvunced shift from risk aversion to risk taking. We have observed this reversal in several groups of respondents, including university faculty and physicians. Inconsistent responses to problems 1 and 2 arise from the conjunction of a framing effect with contradictory attitudes toward risks involving gains and losses. We turn now to an analysis of these attitudes" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:108})
\par
"The Evaluation of Prospects The major theory of decision-making under risk is the expected utility model. This model is based on a set of axioms, for example, transitivity of preferences, which provide criteria for the rationality of choices. The choices of an individual who conforms to the axioms can be described in terms of the utilities of various outcomes for that individual. The utility of a risky prospect is equal to the expected utility of its outcomes, obtained by weighting the utility of each possible outcome by its probability. When faced with a choice, a rational decision-maker will prefer the prospect that offers the highest expected utility (1, 2" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/2}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:108})
\par
"The Framing of Contingencies The following triple of problems illustrates the framing of contingencies" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/4}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:110})
\par
"Many significant decisions concern actions that reduce or eliminate the probability of a hazard, at some cost." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/5}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:111})
\par
"The Framing of Outcomes Outcomes are commonly perceived as positive or negative in relation to a reference outcome that is judged neutral. Variations of the reference point can" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/5}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:111})
\par
"These observations highlight the lability of reference outcomes, as well as their role in decision-making. In the examples discussed so far, the neutral reference point was identified by the labeling of outcomes. A diversity of factors determine the reference outcome in everyday life. The reference outcome is usually a state to which one has adapted; it is sometimes set by social norms and expectations; it sometimes corresponds to a level of aspiration, which may or may not be realistic. We have dealt so far with elementary outcomes, such as gains or losses in a single attribute. In many situations, however, an action gives rise to a compound outcome, which joins a series of changes in a single attribute, such as a sequence of monetary gains and losses, or a set of concurrent changes in several attributes. To describe the framing and evaluation of compound outcomes, we use the notion of a psychological account, defined as an outcome frame which specifies (i) the set of elementary outcomes that are evaluated jointly and the manner in which they are combined and (ii) a reference outcome that is considered neutral or normal. In the account that is set up for the purchase of a car, for example, the cost of the purchase is not treated as a loss nor is the car viewed as a gift. Rather, the transaction as a whole is evaluated as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on such factors as the performance of the car and the price of similar cars in the market. A closely related treatment has been offered by Thaler (18)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/5}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:111})
\par
"We propose that people generally evaluate acts in terms of a minimal account, which includes only the direct consequences of the act. The minimal account associated with the decision to accept a gamble, for example, includes the money won or lost in that gamble and excludes other assets or the outcome of" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/5}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:111})
\par
"Discussion In this article we have presented a series of demonstrations in which seemingly inconsequential changes in the formuiation of choice problems caused significant shifts of preference" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:112})
\par
"consistencies were traced to the interaction of two sets of factors: variations in the framing of acts, contingencies, and outcomes, and the characteristic nonlinearities of values and decision weights. The demonstrated effects are large' and systematic, although by no means universal. They occur when the outcomes concern the loss of human lives as well as in choices about money; they are not restricted to hypothetical questions and are not eliminated by monetary incentives." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:112})
\par
"The metaphor of changing perspective can be applied to other phenomena of choice, in addition to the framing effects with which we have been concerned here (19). The problem of self-control is naturally construed in these terms. The story of Ulysses' request to be bound to the mast of the ship in anticipation of the irresistible temptation of the Sirens' call is o'ften used as a paradigm case (22). In this example of precommitment, an action taken in the present renders inoperative an anticipated future preference. An unusual feature of the problem of intertemporal conflict is that the agent who views a problem from a particular temporal perspective is also aware of the conflicting views that future perspectives will offer. In most other situations, decision-makers are not normally aware of the potential effects of different decision' frames on their preferences" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:112})
\par
"The perspective metaphor highlights the following aspects of the psychology of choice. Individuals who face a decision problem and have a definite preference (i) might have a different preference in a different framing of the same problem, (ii) are normally unaware of alternative frames and of their potential effects on the relative attractiveness of options," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/6}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:112})
\par
"(iii) would wish their preferences to be independent of frame, but (iv) are often uncertain how to resolve detected incon-; sistencies (23). In some cases (such as problems 3 and 4 and perhaps problems 8 and 9) the advantage of one frame becomes evident once the competing frames are compared, but in other cases- (problems 1 and 2 and problems 6 and 7) it is not obvious which preferences should be abandoned" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:113})
\par
"The present work has been concerned primarily with the descriptive question of how decisions are made, but the psychology of choice is aiso relevant to the normative question of how decisions ought to be made. In order to avoid the difficult problem of justifying values, the modern theory of rational choice has adopted the coherence of specific preferences as the sole criterion of rationality. This approach enjoins the decisionnzaker to resolve inconsistencies but offers no guidaxlce on how to do so. It implicitly assumes that the decisionmaker who carefully answers the questio ';What do I really want?" will eventually achieve coherent preferences. However, the susceptibility of preforences to variations of framing raises doubt about the feasibility and adequacy of the coherence criterion" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:113})
\par
"Consistency is only one aspect of the lay notion of rational behavior. As noted by March (?6), the common conception of rationality also requires that preferences or utilities for particular outcomes should be predictive of the experiences of satisfaction or displeasure associated with their occurrence. Thus, a man could be judged irratioIlal either because his preferences are contradictory or because his desires and aversions do not reflect his pleasures and pains. The-predictive criterion of rationality can be applied to resolve inconsistent preferences and to improve the quality of decisions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_KYMK2CM7/7}{Tversky and Kahneman 1985:113})
\par
"dictive orientation encourages the decision-maker to focus on future experience and to ask " What will I feel then?" rather than "What do I want now?" The former question, when answered with care, can be the more useful guide in difficult decisions. In particular, predictive considerations may be applied to select the decision frame that best represents the hedonic experience of outcomes."

  abstract = {The present study examines the persuasive effects of tailored health messages comparing those tailored to match (versus not match) both chronic cultural frame and momentarily salient cultural frame. Evidence from two studies (Study 1: n = 72 European Americans; Study 2: n = 48 Asian Americans) supports the hypothesis that message persuasiveness increases when chronic cultural frame, health message tailoring and momentarily salient cultural frame all match. The hypothesis was tested using a message about health risks of caffeine consumption among individuals prescreened to be regular caffeine consumers. After being primed for individualism, European Americans who read a health message that focused on the personal self were more likely to accept the message\textendash they found it more persuasive, believed they were more at risk and engaged in more message-congruent behaviour. These effects were also found among Asian Americans who were primed for collectivism and who read a health message that focused on relational obligations. The findings point to the importance of investigating the role of situational cues in persuasive effects of health messages and suggest that matching content to primed frame consistent with the chronic frame may be a way to know what to match messages to.},

  abstract = {This study presents two extensions to the two-stage expectationconfirmation theory of information systems (IS) continuance. First, we expand the belief set from perceived usefulness in the original IS continuance model to include three additional predictors identified in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, namely effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions. Second, we ground the IS continuance model in the context of transactional systems that involve transmission of personal and sensitive information and include trust as a key contextual belief in the model. To test the expanded IS continuance model, we conducted a longitudinal field study of 3159 Hong Kong citizens across two electronic government (e-government) technologies that enable citizens' access to government services. In general, the results support the expanded model that provides a rich understanding of the changes in the preusage beliefs and attitudes through the emergent constructs of disconfirmation and satisfaction, ultimately influencing IS continuance intention. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the expanded model.},

"Conceptual models are generally derived from variance (factor) or process theories (Markus and Robey 1988; Mohr 1982). Variance theories incorporate independent variables that cause variation in dependent variables. In contrast, process theories use events and states to help explain dynamic phenomena. Thus, models may look very different in the two approaches (see Figure 1 of Langley [1999] for examples of these two types of models). Of course, review articles may draw from both variance and process research to develop conceptual models to guide future research. In fact, DiMaggio (1995, p. 392) argued that \`imany of the best theories are hybrids, combining the best qualities\^i of these approaches. Moreover, Sabherwal and Robey (1995) demonstrate how the two approaches can be reconciled in one study. Thus, do not treat the results of variance and process research as independent elements of a review. Rather, make every effort to show how these two approaches reveal a deeper understanding of the topic. For example, the explanatory power of a process model might be contingent on the strength of a particular variable, as Newman and Sabherwal (1991) illustrate."

Exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors (Focused Attention, Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, and Satisfaction) as compared to the six found in the original development of the UES. In the context of video game-play, a revised UES (UESz) demonstrated better psychometric properties than the original UES defined by six subscales, including enhanced reliability. Further validity analysis included comparisons with the Flow State Scale (FSS), showing the complementary nature of the two scales and what constructs both scales might be measuring in a video game context. Criterion validity analysis demonstrated that UESz was more predictive of game performance than the FSS. Findings related to both the UESz and FSS were discussed relative to an overarching framework of hedonic and utilitarian qualities of game-play.},

Where intention is defined as the "mental characterization of the desired goal", selection is the translation of an intention to an action by the selection of one of the available options, execution involves entering the command selected into the computer system and evaluation is a review of the executed action to direct further activity. The process of selection requires the user to know the options availabl to him. This information can be acquired in one of four ways: the information may be retrieved from the user's memory, the user's memory may be jogged by the system, a manual or anothe user, the user may construct or derive an option in a problem-solving fashion, or the user may learn the information through external search of manuals, the system or other people These four stages have connections to those proposed for organizational decision-making by Simon (1977), who similarly identified four phases in the search for decision-relate information: the intelligence phase, where raw data from the environment are obtained and processed to identify problems (which may be seen as preceding Norman's intention phase); the design phase, in which problems are clarified, potential solutions are assessed for feasibility and a course of action is developed (which overlaps with Norman's intention phase); the choice phase, when a feasible solution is selected and implemented (which is clearly identical to Norman's selection); and the review, which equates to evaluation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZUACV23R?page=14}{Wilson 1997:564})

"Some Definitions Some definitions are needed before we go further. In this paper, four terms are used: information behavior, information seeking behavior, information searching behavior and information use behavior. They are defined as follows: Information Behavior is the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information seeking, and information use. Thus, it includes faceto-face communication with others, as well as the passive reception of information as in, for example, watching TV advertisements, without any intention to act on the information given. Information Seeking Behavior is the purposive seeking for information as a consequence of a need to satisfy some goal. In the course of seeking, the individual may interact with manual information systems (such as a newspaper or a library), or with computer-based systems (such as the World Wide Web). Information Searching Behavior is the 'micro-level' of behavior employed by the searcher in interacting with information systems of all kinds. It consists of all the interactions with the system, whether at the level of human computer interaction (for example, use of the mouse and clicks on links) or at the intellectual level (for example, adopting a Boolean search strategy or determining the criteria for deciding which of two books selected from adjacent places on a library shelf is most useful), which will also involve mental acts, such as judging the relevance of data or information retrieved." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/2}{Wilson 2000:50})
\par
"Information Use Behavior consists of the physical and mental acts involved in incorporating the information found into the person's existing knowledge base. It may involve, therefore, physical acts such as marking sections in a text to note their importance or significance, as well as mental acts that involve, for example, comparison of new information with existing knowledge." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/3}{Wilson 2000:51})
\par
"In all of the above definitions data is subsumed under information, that is, data may or may not be information depending upon the state of understanding of the information user" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/3}{Wilson 2000:51})
\par
"In all of this, the term knowledge is avoided, on the grounds that knowledge is knowable only to the knower. It cannot be transmitted - only information about the knowledge I have can be recorded and accessed by another person, and that information can only ever be an incomplete surrogate for the knowledge. Hence, knowledge management systems are nothing of the kind - they are, at best, information systems, just as information systems in the past used to be nothing but dataprocessing systems - and, in some cases, still are. This paper is concerned mainly with information seeking behavior." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/3}{Wilson 2000:51})
\par
"The noted scientist, J.D. Bernal, Professor of Physics at Birkbeck College, ended his paper (Bernal, 1958) with a statement that is worth recalling: "...a knowledge of the requirements of the different users of scientific information and the uses to which they wish to put the information they secure should be the ultimate determining factor in the designing of methods of storage and retrieval of scientific information" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/3}{Wilson 2000:51})
\par
"most work until the early mid-1970s was concerned with system use rather than user behavior. The papers referred to from the 1958 Washington conference were typical of then and of the later period. There was little beyond a catalogue of types of information sources (journals, abstracts, patents, standards, etc.) used by scientists and engineers - what they were used for was not explored. Since the 1980s there has been a shift towards a "personcentred" approach, rather than a "system-centred" approach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/4}{Wilson 2000:52})

"ing behavior that is prompted by the individual's physiological, cognitive and effective needs (Wilson, 1981)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/5}{Wilson 2000:53})
\par
"He goes on to note that the context of any one of these needs may be the person himor herself, or the role demands of the person's work or life, or the environments (political, economic, technological, etc.) within which that life or work takes place. He then suggests that the barriers that impede the search for information will arise out of the same set of contexts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/5}{Wilson 2000:53})
\par
"Dervin developed the sense-making approach, which is implemented in terms of four constituent elements - a situation in time and space, which defines the context in which information problems arise; a gap, which identifies the difference between the contextual situation and the desired situation (e.g. uncertainty); an outcome, that is, the consequences of the sense-making process, and a bridge, that is, some means of closing the gap between situation and outcome (Dervin, 1983)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/5}{Wilson 2000:53})
\par
"These elements are presented in terms of a triangle: situation, gap/bridge, and outcome. Dervin defines her approach not simply as a model or a method but as "...a set of assumptions, \textbf{a theoretic perspective, a methodological approach, a set of research methods, and a practice."" }(\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/5}{Wilson 2000:53})

"or example, a "need for cognition" test has been devised by Cacioppo, Petty \& Kao (1984) to measure a general trait related to an individual's motivation to engage in cognitive acts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/0_BG5DCMHI/5}{Wilson 2000:53})
\par
"Given the definition of "need for cognition", I think it would have been surprising if no such relationship had been found, but the hypothesis was confirmed in a laboratory test (a test closely related to marketing in that it concerned information relating to a product)."

  abstract = {We propose a research model based on Media Synchronicity Theory (MST) and examine how the use of different symbol sets (e.g., images and text) is related to audience engagement on social media. We include uses and gratifications theory (UGT) in the model to identify task characteristics that are relevant to message recipients in the specific context of community policing. Based on our analyses of Facebook posts by five police departments we find first that, consistent with MST, posts conveying information garner more responses when accompanied by more natural symbol sets, and more textual content is preferred to less, but responses differ depending on the type of engagement: intimacy (likes), interaction (comments), or influence (shares). Second, posts intended for meaning convergence gratify the audience's socialization and assistance needs and are positively related to intimacy and interaction. Finally, the fit between symbol sets and task characteristics impacts different dimensions of audience engagement. These findings provide empirical support for relying on MST when studying social media and for integrating with UGT to capture contextual task characteristics. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of its findings for theory and offer recommendations for practice.},
